<h2>1.1.1. Historical timeline of the biology of development  </h2>
 
 


<p>
	<strong>Science of how the organisms form</strong>
</p>


<p>
	The definition of development has its own embryology: it changed with the numerous discoveries which punctuated the history of this field of research.
</p>


<p>
	A general definition would state that development is a dynamical process which leads a given organism to a given morphological state and that Development Biology is the study of the mechanisms which rule the coordination of cellular differentiation through space and time in multi-cellular organism.
</p>


<p>
	It is interesting to note that this process never ends, the morphological state of an organism changes until senescence.
</p>

<p>
	This process is not steady, organisms may alternate period of dramatic changes with quiet period or growth period. 
</p>


<p>
	<strong>Evolution of concept and terminology</strong>
</p>


traduit une évolution des pratiques



<p>
	If Hippocrates is often labeled as the first embryologist, in his Hippocratic Collection, he describes the successive stages of incubation of hens'eggs <a name='Needham:1931tz' class='ref'></a>, 

	Aristotle's &quot;De Generatione Animalium&quot; initiated the main theory of the formation of living organism, which still hold today. This theory, called &quot;epigenesis&quot;, states that organisms develop through changes of shape. New parts appear and deform themselves by a serie of stages. 

	In book II of &quot;De Generatione Animalium&quot;, Aristotle foresaw the alternative theory which resisted until the 18th century: &quot;preformation&quot;. It states that no new structure are generated during development, but parts simply unfold and grow. His words was: &quot;Either all the parts, as heart, lung, liver, eye, and all the rest, come into being together or in succession, as is said in the verse ascribed to Orpheus, for there he says that an animal comes into being in the same way as the knitting of a net.&quot; <a name='Aristotle:WxoMhbAm' class='ref'></a>.
</p>

the preformationists' parenthesis
preformation The organisms develop from miniature versions of themselves. Simple growth of the part without differentiation.

<p>
	A third hypothesis was developed by Aristotle in the &quot;Historia animalium&quot; <a name='Aristotle:WxoMhbAm' class='ref'></a>. Synthesizing contemporary thought, he introduces the theory of &quot;spontaneous generation&quot;. This theory proposes that some complex organisms, like insects, are generated from non-living matter, like putrefying earth, vegetable matter or dead flesh.
</p>


jusqu'au 18 ieme pas grand chose

<p>
	In 1651, William Harvey was among the firsts to consider embryonic development as a dynamic process requiring causal explanations of the sequences of events <a name='Horder:2010uj' class='ref'></a>.
</p>

<p>
	In 1664, Descartes' &quot;De la formation du foetus&quot; <a name='Descartes:1677un' class='ref'></a> is posthumously published and it contains the first attempt to explain the formation of an animal embryo by the means of mechanical interactions. The male and female seeds would heat up and ferment until some of their particles would start to move and form the organs, from the heart which would push the blood directly towards the place it is freest to go and participating at the formation of the brain <a name='Roger:1998td' class='ref'></a>. 
</p>

la fin de la generation spontanée

<p>
	In 1668, Gregorio Redi realizes an experiment which discredits the spontaneous generation hypotheses by showing that no fly can form in a closed jar containing food or already dead flies. As maggots would appear when the same experiment was run in open jar, he concludes that the food or the dead flies could not produce maggots by themselves <a name='Theriseofembryolo:2000uf' class='ref'></a>. The final blow to this theory was struck by Louis Pasteur two centuries later (1859) when, as a young chemist, he shown that a boiled meat broth would not produce new organisms. The game changer (XXXXXX) of his experimental setup was that he bent the neck of the container to give it a S shape. It allowed air to pass through it but not the aerial microorganism because of the gravity grounding them. When the broth was put in touch with inflexion point of the neck, a culture would rapidly start to grow.

</figure>


<p>
	The contention between preformists and the upholders of epigenesis lasted for a longer time. 

	Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was a Dutch scientist who created various microscopes. In 1676, he made the first observation of single-celled organisms, &quot;animalcules&quot;, soon after Robert Hooke has first described and termed the &quot;cells&quot; <a name='Hooke:2005vy' class='ref'></a>. Leeuwenhoek was discovered that the sperm cells of animals, among which humans, was entering the egg cell <a name='Gest:2004fj' class='ref'></a>. In addition to his contribution to the refutation of spontaneous generation, this discovery favored the spermist side of the preformation camp. Some of them started to describe miniatured humanoid shapes as did Nicolaas Hartsoeker in 1695 (<a name='homonculi_Hartsoecker_1695' class='fig'></a>).

passage de descriptif a experimental très important. 
description -> too speculative ??
experimental -> more serious ??
from hopwood:
"By the 1880s, academic embryology was in turmoil. The inability of teachers
to agree, especially on the relative weighting of embryological and comparative
anatomical evidence, turned influential students away from evolutionary
morphology. They abandoned problems such as the origin of the vertebrates
to focus on narrower questions, which they expected to answer using a more
limited selection of materials, and many modeled their science on experimental
physiology. Indeed, by opposing “experimental” to “descriptive” embryology,
the more militant secured an identity as experimental biologists in a
science they saw as overly descriptive and rife with unsupported speculation.
In the 1970s and 1980s, historians of biology reinvestigated the changes in
embryology between 1880 andWorldWar I as exemplifying that wider transformation
in the organization, problems, institutions, and methods of the life
sciences by which biology as we know it was made. Experimental embryology
and genetics were taken as model subdisciplines. Initial efforts to generalize
tended to reinforce a one-dimensional view of a “revolt from morphology,”
but later studies worked to produce a more nuanced and inclusive history.31
Yet the very agenda of searching for the origins of the new biology has underestimated
continuities and excluded significant innovations in human and
comparative embryological research."
->pas bien compris


descriptive bio unique tool to test evo hypotheses: for example comparing different species to investigate the relations of phylogeny and ontogeny. ??
experiment for development only questions??



"Experiment, we can conclude, worked in two ways: as a practice and as a
rhetoric, even an ideology.41 As a practice, experiment became the method
of highest status. As a rhetoric, experimentalism associated its practitioners
with modern rigor and control and simultaneously created “descriptive
embryology” as its unglamorous other, ideally relegated to a “classical” past.
Experiment did not in fact replace analysis but was added to it. Experimentalists
sought to reveal the potentialities of parts and analyzed operated embryos
for the presence or absence of tissues, cells, or molecules; they also invested
time in making standards, “normal stages” adapted from Keibel’s plates and
“fate maps,” against which to assess the effects of their interventions. Nor
did “descriptive embryology” just fade slowly into the background; in the
years before World War I, when most histories have experimenters making
all the running, “descriptive” embryologists founded both the first specifically
embryological society and the first research institution dedicated to the
science. And though the war seriously disrupted the European initiatives,
comparative work continued."

<p>
	Spemann organizer
</p>


<p>
	In 1924, Hans Spemann and his PhD student Hilde Mangold reported the discovery a tissue in the Newt gastrula which, when grafted on the ectodermal region of another Newt embryo, triggers a neurulating process and initiates the formation of a secondary embryonic axis (Spemann, H. & Mangold, H., 1924. über Induktion von Embryonalanlagen durch Implantation artfremder Organisatoren. Wilhelm Roux' Archiv fur Entwicklungsmechanik der Organismen, 100(3-4), pp.599–638. <a name='Spemann:1924ky' class='ref'></a>). This tissue was denominated the <i>organizer</i> as it was able to instruct and organize the adjacent ectoderm. Spemann proposed two different speculative mechanisms: either the existence of a chemical substance that would be transmitted to the induced tissue or the inducing tissue would possess a specific vitalistic &quot;structure&quot; associated to the living embryo <a name='Holtfreter:1991wi' class='ref'></a>. These hypotheses became the focus of intensive study around the world.
</p>

<p>
	Boiling, dessicating and other tissue killing experiment exercised on the Spemann organizer rapidly dismissed the second hypotheses. The organizer was not any more actively organizing the formation of the induced organs but simply releasing a water-diffusible chemical agent which would initiated the self-organization of the induced tissue. A global quest on the identity(ies) of the inducing substances started around the world.

	<strong>Development and genetics</strong>
</p>

section inspired by Gilbert, S.F., 1991. Induction and the Origins of Developmental Genetics. <a name='Gilbert:1991ww' class='ref'></a>

<p>
	In the early 20th century, embryology and genetics were both part of the larger field of heredity and were tightly entangled. A split was initiated by the work of Thomas Morgan who proposed that,  to avoid confusion, embryology would study the expression of the hereditary traits whereas genetics would deal only with the transmission of those traits (see chapter II of &quot;The Theory of the Gene&quot; <a name='Morgan:1926wt' class='ref'></a>). From this time, some biologists tried to reunite both fields, leading the emerging field of developmental genetics. 
</p>

<p>
	The first publication which founded this field is the work of Gluecksohn-Schoenheimer which interpreted the defect in the induction of the mouse notochord as the consequence of a mutation of the Brachy gene (<a name='GluecksohnSchoenheimer:1938vk' class='ref'></a>, <a name='GluecksohnSchoenheimer:1940wg' class='ref'></a>). The result not only pioneered developmental genetics but it also proposed a new methodology for the study of embryology. Instead of perturbing the development of embryo and observe the consequences of the phenotype, mutant phenotype were to be observed first and cause had to be decipher from it.
</p>

<p>
	This methodological dichotomy would be resolved decades later with the experimental generation of mutants selected by the observation of their phenotypes. (like chemically induced random mutation in <i>Drosophila</i> by Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus in 1980 <a name='NussleinVolhard:1980wg' class='ref'></a> or in Zebrafish a few years later <a name='NussleinVolhard:2012kb' class='ref'></a>)

(JACOB, F. & MONOD, J., 1961. Genetic regulatory mechanisms in the synthesis of proteins. Journal of molecular biology, 3, pp.318–356. <a name='JACOB:1961uh' class='ref'></a>) : already envisioned the influence of this discovery on induction, as the controlling mechanism of induction -> &quot;The occurrence of inductive and repressive effects in tissues of higher organisms has been observed in many instances (...). It has repeatedly been pointed out that enzymatic adaptation, as studied in micro-organisms, offers a valuable model for the interpretation of biochemical co-ordination within tissues and between organs in higher organisms. The demonstration that adaptive effects in micro-organisms are primarily negative (repressive), that they are controlled by functionally specialized genes and operate at the genetic level, would seem greatly to widen the possibilities of interpretation. The fundamental problem of chemical physiology and embryology is to understand why tissue cells do not all express, all the time, all the potentialities inherent in their genome.&quot; (fin de l'article)

	genes expression is regulated by multiple &quot;transcription factors&quot; (TF) which target a specific region of the DNA. 


	This region is called &quot;<i>cis</i>-regulatory&quot; because the portion of DNA on which bind the TFs is usually on the same DNA molecule as the genes they regulate (<a name='Davidson:2006ud' class='ref'></a>).



	activation/ inhibition 



	control rate of transcription (? really, how is it not only 0 or 1, dynamical regulation with TF level controling the expression to maintain it at a certain level. If the expression of the gene is too low, the GRN activates its <i>cis</i>-regulatory system and inhibite if the expression is too high).
	--> not really :
	&quot;For one thing, it is relatively easy to measure transcriptional output directly and thus short-circuit this issue; or as done by Bolouri and Davidson (2003) a more or less mechanism-independent assumption can be made that transcriptional activity is proportional to driver site occupancy until it approaches the saturating absolute value of the maximum transcription rate characteristic of the system.&quot; (Davidson, E.H., 2006. The Regulatory Genome, Academic Press. <a name='Davidson:2006ud' class='ref'></a>)
	&quot;The rates or intensities of expression of differentiation genes are also subject to posttranscriptional modulation, as well as to modulation at the transcriptional level. This last can occur by target site divergence in cis-regulatory modules regulating individual structural genes, or in the modules regulating the battery controllers.&quot; (Davidson, E.H., 2006.

Various cell types in animal but only a few signaling pathways

<p>
	Wnt signalling

	&quot;These signalling systems operate beyond cell and tissue boundaries, but function as morphogens that are secreted from one cell or tissue type to activate surface receptors, signal transduction components and transcription factors in neighbouring cells or tissues, regulating processes such as cell proliferation, survival or differentiation.&quot;

	The <i>Wnt</i> gene has been discovered multiple times in different animals. Its name itself is the contraction of the two occurrences <i>Int1</i> which was characterized in 1982 by Nusse and Varmus as a gene inducing mammary gland tumours in mice (Nusse, R. & Varmus, H.E., 1982. Many tumors induced by the mouse mammary tumor virus contain a provirus integrated in the same region of the host genome. Cell, 31(1), pp.99–109. <a name='Nusse:1982wu' class='ref'></a>) and its homologue <i>Wingless</i> (<i>Wg</i>), described in 1973 as a gene provoking <i>Drosophila</i> wings'lacking mutants <a name='Sharma:1973wy' class='ref'></a>. The <i>Wg</i> mutation was later associated with default in the <i>Drosophila</i> segmentation process (Nüsslein-Volhard, C. & Wieschaus, E., 1980. Mutations affecting segment number and polarity in Drosophila. Nature, 287(5785), pp.795–801. <a name='NussleinVolhard:1980wg' class='ref'></a>).

<p><strong>Mechanotransduction</strong>: mechanical action on the cell as a regulatory input (either through genetic regulation or cytoplasmic regulation)</p>



<p>a review : <strong>Eyckmans, J. et al., 2011. A Hitchhiker's Guide to Mechanobiology. Developmental cell see</strong> <a name='Eyckmans:2011fy' class='ref'></a></p>


<p>First theory involving mechanical forces:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Wolff, J. Das Gesetz der Transformation der Knochen. (Hirschwald: 1892)</strong> <a name='wolff1892gesetz' class='ref'></a>: the mechanical environment impacts the structure of bone tissue after healing of fractures.</li>
	<li><strong>Roux, W. Gesammelte Abhandlungen über Entwicklungsmechanik der Organismen. (1895)</strong> <a name='Roux:1895vb' class='ref'></a> and <strong>Thompson, D. A. W. On Growth and Form. (Cambridge University Press: 1917)</strong> <a name='thompson1992growth' class='ref'></a>: mechanical forces shape tissues and organs during embryonic development</li>
</ul>


<p>More recently externally applied forces have impact on cellular proliferation (in bone , vascular system), cell signaling (endothelial and smooth muscle ).

<p>me: looking like first in vitro experiments started in early 1980s: force pressure exerted on cells modify cell function. Particularly, study on blood-flow-dependent shear stress on cells in angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>see in <strong>Davies, P.F. et al., 1984. Influence of hemodynamic forces on vascular endothelial function. In vitro studies of shear stress and pinocytosis in bovine aortic cells. The Journal of clinical investigation, 73(4), pp.1121–1129.</strong> <a name='Davies:1984gv' class='ref'></a></p>

<p>me: does not seem to emphasize the mechanotransduction but rather the specific discovery. Need to find a more &quot;important&quot; paper...</p>

<p>me: another one <strong>Franke, R.P. et al., 1984. Induction of human vascular endothelial stress fibres by fluid shear stress. Nature, 307(5952), pp.648–649.</strong> see <a name='Franke:1984gc' class='ref'></a></p>

<p>molecular transduction units: "many anatomical sites could be involved in transducing such forces into biochemical signals (Eyckmans)"</p>



<p>site 1: force-induced nuclear deformations can directly alter genomic structure and accessibility of transcription factors to specific genetic targets, but no direct demonstration of such a mechanism has yet been described (Eyk)</p>


<p>me: mechanotransdution catogory 1: as a source of cytoplasmic reaction (not involving genetic regulation but may need a certain state given by genetic regulation)</p>


<p>site 2: adherent junctions</p>

<p><strong>Nelson, C.M. et al., 2005. Emergent patterns of growth controlled by multicellular form and mechanics. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</strong> <a name='Nelson:2005dd' class='ref'></a> study of the impact of tension and adhesion on the spatial pattern of proliferation in in vitro multicellular system (experiment + modeling). Endothelial cells. Results the higher the mechanical stress, the more the cells proliferate. Chemically inhibiting cytoskeletal tension-responsible molecules (rho kinase, myosin II ATPase with blebbistatin) induces a reduction of proliferation rate.</p>

<p>More recently, in 3D epithelial tissues (branching pattern) in <strong>Gjorevski, N. and Nelson, C.M., 2010. Endogenous patterns of mechanical stress are required for branching morphogenesis. Integrative Biology</strong> <a name='Gjorevski:2010gb' class='ref'></a>: &quot;branching only occurred at locations where the biochemical and mechanical cues were predicted to reinforce each other&quot; and &quot;We found also that the magnitude of mechanical stress at branching sites correlated with the extent of branching: decreasing the magnitude of stress by decreasing cellular contractility or matrix stiffness resulted in decreased branching, whereas increasing the magnitude of stress resulted in increased branching.&quot;</p>

<p>both previous papers evoke &quot;mechanical gradients&quot;</p>

<p>in vivo context, drosophila mesoderm invagination in <strong>Martin, A.C. et al., 2010. Integration of contractile forces during tissue invagination. The Journal of cell biology</strong> <a name='Martin:2010je' class='ref'></a>: feedback between actomyosin meshwork pulsing contraction and intracellular adhesion through adherent junctions. No influence on the GRN regulation (twist and snail are required but nothing shows that they are up-regulated by mechanotransduced signals)</p>

<p>Drosophila again, <strong>Fernandez-Gonzalez, R. et al., 2009. Myosin II dynamics are regulated by tension in intercalating cells. Developmental cell</strong> <a name='FernandezGonzalez:2009hp' class='ref'></a>: &quot;myosin II is stabilized at the cortex in regions of increased tension. Myosin II is recruited in response to an ectopic force and relieving tension leads to a rapid loss of myosin, indicating that tension is necessary and sufficient for cortical myosin localization.&quot;</p>


<p>site 3: hemidesmosme</p>

<p>in <strong>Zhang, H. et al., 2011. A tension-induced mechanotransduction pathway promotes epithelial morphogenesis. Nature</strong> <a name='Zhang:2011do' class='ref'></a> (C Elegans): &quot;By compressing muscle-defective mutant embryos between a blunted microneedle tip and a programmable microscope stage, the authors were able to rescue GIT1 signaling and CeHD maturation, thus providing a link between muscle-generated tension and longitudinal growth in C. elegans.&quot; (Eyk)</p>




<p>me: the real deal, mechanotransduction category 2: developmental genes activation induced by external force:</p>

<p>in <strong>Desprat, N. et al., 2008. Tissue deformation modulates twist expression to determine anterior midgut differentiation in Drosophila embryos. Developmental cell</strong> <a name='Desprat:2008ei' class='ref'></a>, show how compression forces between two cell types during Drosophila germ band elongation can induce the expression of Twist, a transcription factor that regulates the differentiation of the anterior midgut. (Eyk) magnetic microtweezers were used to push the magnetized patch against the stomodeal cells with a force of 60 ± 20 nN. These mechanical manipulations rescued Armadillo/beta catenin translocation from the cell junctions to the nucleus which restored transcription of Twist (Eyk)</p>


<p>me: the real deal 2, mechanotransduction category 3: internal polarizaton of the cell induced by external force:</p>

<p>in <strong>Weber, G.F., Bjerke, M.A. &amp; Desimone, D.W., 2011. A Mechanoresponsive Cadherin-Keratin Complex Directs Polarized Protrusive Behavior and Collective Cell Migration. Developmental cell</strong> <a name='Weber:2011hi' class='ref'></a> (Xenopus): local pulling on C-cadherins induces polarization of the internal structure of the cell (keratin intermediate filament toward stressed sites, plakoglobin at the cadherin adhesion sites. Cell protrudes and migrates/intercalates at the other end of the cell. It explains how in multicellular protruding ensemble, intercalation axes align, and (maybe) how a migration signal can be propagated (if these cells are in a certain state) ). Still need to elucidate how to drive this powerful property.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Internalization (germ ring - XXX)</strong>
</p>



<p>
	General : &quot;In zebrafish, the first mesendodermal progenitors are induced at the margin of the blastoderm when the blastoderm starts to spread over the yolk cell (dome stage) (for reviews, see Kimelman and Schier, 2002; Warga and Stainier, 2002). When the blastoderm covers about half of the yolk cell (50% epiboly), the germ ring forms as a local thickening at the margin of the blastoderm. Germ ring formation is accompanied by convergence movements of blastodermal cells, leading to a compaction of cells at the dorsal side of the germ ring, where the embryonic organizer or ‘shield’ forms (Warga and Kane, 2003). This is also the time, when mesendodermal progenitors within the germ ring begin to internalize by moving first to the margin of the blastoderm, then downwards in direction of the yolk sac and eventually migrating back towards the animal pole of the gastrula (Warga and Kimmel, 1990).&quot; Montero, J.-A. et al., 2005. Shield formation at the onset of zebrafish gastrulation. Development, 132(6), pp.1187–1198. <a name='Montero:2005kq' class='ref'></a>
</p>



<p>
	# Internalization mode
</p>


<p>
	Ingression (dorsal ?) vs involution (ventral ?), border or continuous between two modes
</p>


<p>
	Two questions :
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Q1. intra-internalizing tissue motility (involution vs ingression)</li>
	<li>Q2. if ingression, are internalizing cells mixed (intermingled) with non-internalizing cells or is there a clear cut ?</li>
</ul>


<p>
	&quot;<i>Involution</i> is the flowing of a sheet of cells over the edge of an inpocketing, where invagination has occured, such as at the blastopore during amphibian gastrulation.&quot; (Trinkaus, J.P., 1996. Ingression during early gastrulation of fundulus. Developmental Biology, 177(1), pp.356–370. <a name='Trinkaus:1996ju' class='ref'></a>): trinkaus does not consider fundulus to perform &quot;classical involution&quot; as does the Amphibia. Involution is associated with the internalization of cohesive sheet of cells in opposition to <i>ingression</i> which concerns &quot;individuals or small clusters of individuals&quot; which &quot;sink inside as individuals, changing their relations to each other in the process&quot;. The motility pattern is different. In the involuting tissue, there is no internal topological rearrangement between the cells. Ingressing cells have higher topological rearrangement and may even be mixed with non-internalizing tissue.
</p>

<p>
	Whether the term <i>involution</i> is suited in zebrafish or not, we use it as an archetypic description which characterizes the motion of a collective sheet of cell plunging toward the yolk mass and turning back toward the animal pole.
</p>

<p>
	Q1. ingression Q2. cell-autonomous. in (Carmany-Rampey, A. & Schier, A.F., 2001. Single-cell internalization during zebrafish gastrulation. Current biology : CB, 11(16), pp.1261–1265. <a name='CarmanyRampey:2001uy' class='ref'></a>): uses MZoep mutants which do no internalize at all. When MZoep mutant cells are transplanted to the margin of wild-type embryos, the internalization appears to happen normally but they do not migrate towards the animal pole. (mon avis, ça peux potentiellement arriver aussi chez le WT). The vice-versa transplantation would make the transplanted WT cell internalize propertly and form a mesendodermal marker expressing tissue + &quot;Interestingly, in MZoep embryos the wild-type cells internalized by directly moving deep toward the yolk without first moving to the most vegetal region of the margin, as in wild-type embryos.&quot; (on pourrait aussi imaginer que cette ingression individuelle n'est pas dû à une motilité intrinseque des cellules plongeantes mais que les cellules plongeantes sont éjectées vers le yolk par les cellules epiblastiques qui s'intercalent. Pour tester ça, on pourrait imaginer une transplantation de MZoep dans un mutant qui stoppe l'intercalation radial (hab?) et observer si les cellules ingressent quand meme -> si non, bingo !!)
</p>


<p>
	Q1. Ingression Q2.Clear cut?? in (Montero, J.-A. et al., 2005. Shield formation at the onset of zebrafish gastrulation. Development, 132(6), pp.1187–1198. <a name='Montero:2005kq' class='ref'></a>): internalizing cells delaminate as single cells within more than&quot; 4-5 cell diameters away from the tip of the germ ring&quot;.

(not so convincing... the same argument is used to draw opposite conclusion in Montero, J.-A. et al., 2005. Shield formation at the onset of zebrafish gastrulation.

This mechanism is shown to be sufficient to drive epithelial epiboly after 50%-epiboly because, in mechanically constrained cylindrical embryos, where a purse-string scenario is inefficient, the margin is still converging to the vegetal pole. An undiscussed hypothesis would also be sufficient to reproduce these observations is the possibility that the epiblast radial intercalation could explain the persistent epiboly in cylindrical embryos. (we should image that, if the epiblast is closed to the margin, the flow-friction force is challenged XXXX).

</p>



<p>
	Epiblast deep cells intercalate radially from interior layer to the sub-evl layer. They change their shape to actively drive the epiboly.

</p>




<p>

</p>


<p>
	&quot;Starting during the mid-gastrula stage, YSL nuclei initiate long-range convergent-extension movements toward the dorsal midline (see Figs. 6, 7). Concurrently, there is an extension in the AP direction of the YSL nuclei that either reside in, or enter, the dorsal region. This convergence and extension pattern is intriguing because it is achieved in a syncytial cell that has no boundaries between the individual nuclei. It seems likely that the extensive microtubule arrays that interlink YSL nuclei (Solnica-Krezel and Driever, 1994) play a key role in driving nuclear movements. The movements of YSL nuclei have many similarities to the movements of the overlying deep cells of the blastoderm. It is important to consider whether or not YSL and deep cell movements are independent of each other. The YSL surface serves as a substrate for the crawling of hypoblast cells and, thus, may have some influence on the direction that cells migrate on this surface. The YSL influence on cell migrations may be especially true for the large flat endodermal cells that closely associate with the YSL surface (Warga and Nu¨ sslein-Volhard, 1999). Epiboly of the blastoderm has been shown to be at least partially dependent on the normal epiboly of the YSL (Trinkaus, 1984b; Stra¨hle and Jesuthasan, 1993; Solnica-Krezel and Driever, 1994; Kane et al., 1996; Zalik et al., 1999).&quot;
</p>


<p>
	&quot;An alternative hypothesis is that the motility of deep cells in the blastoderm is responsible for directing the YSL nuclear movements. Is it possible that cells migrating on the surface of the YSL could somehow drag YSL nuclei with them, even though the plasma membrane of the yolk cell physically separates them? Although it is formally plausible that a bulk flow of YSL membrane and YSL cytoplasm could be generated by migrating cells collectively pulling the YSL membrane, this theoretical possibility is unsupported by numerous observations. Previous studies have shown that deep cells migrate individually, in different directions, and independently of underlying YSL nuclei (Warga and Kimmel, 1990; Solnica-Krezel and Driever, 1994; Wilson et al., 1995; Trinkaus, 1996; Warga and Nu¨ sslein- Volhard, 1999). Moreover, it is known that the epiboly movements of the YSL nuclei in both Fundulus and zebrafish are not dependent on the overlying cells of the blastoderm (Trinkaus, 1984a,b, 1993; Kane et al., 1996). Thus, it seems unlikely that the convergentextension movements of YSL nuclei in zebrafish embryos are driven by the convergent-extension movements of deep cells in the overlying blastoderm. A third possibility is that, despite their similarities, the collective movements of deep cells and YSL nuclei are largely autonomous of each other. We discuss phylogenetic evidence for this hypothesis below.&quot;

<p>
	# Oriented cell division is a driving force for axis elongation. 
</p>

<p>
	&quot;Xdd1 disrupts convergence and extension of the dorsal tissue (Fig. 4b)11,13. It is thus possible that the disruption of oriented division observed in Xdd1-overexpressing embryos was due to compromised morphogenesis of the tissue. To address this, we generated mosaic clones of Xdd1-expressing cells in a wild-type background by injecting a single cleavage-stage blastomere. Such embryos undergo normal morphogenesis, and are indistinguishable from unmanipulated controls morphologically (data not shown). Subsequent analysis shows that these mosaic Xdd1-expressing cells have randomized division orientation, with angular distribution similar to that of embryos overexpressing Xdd1 ubiquitously (Fig. 3e, f; see Supplementary Information for details). Thus, Dsh has a cell-autonomous function and exerts its effect on division orientation directly.&quot; ... &quot;Our experiments on the zebrafish dorsal epiblast show both a matching of division orientation and axis elongation normally, and a disruption of oriented cell division and axis elongation after inhibition of PCP signalling. We assessed the contribution of oriented cell division to axis elongation.&quot; (Gong, Y., Mo, C. &amp; Fraser, S.E., 2004. Planar cell polarity signalling controls cell division orientation during zebrafish gastrulation.

It would be really interesting to check in my simulation if, even with random axis, cell are re-oriented by protrusive mechanism (deactivate protrusion for the dividing cell and check if there is many differences).

2 actors : individual and reality / environment

3 process: perception, generation of hypothesis (modeling), experimentation




<h3>Scientists &quot;in the loop&quot;</h3>

<h4>The individual</h4>

<p>
	Experimental science involves an individual and its environment (&quot;Reality&quot;). This activity shares similarities with other of its explanation-seeking activities. 

	Experimental science is characterized by three fundamental processes: the perception of its environment, the generation of new hypotheses and the experimentation on the environment (see figure <a name='experimental_science_schematic' class='fig'></a>). 

</p>




<p>
	1. The loop can be entered by the individual perceiving his environment. 
</p>


<p>
	2. The observations are then matched with the knowledge of the individual. Most of the time, if the observation conforms to the knowledge, no reactive signal is emitted. However, a significant difference would trigger a signal of curiosity which will challenge the existing set of hypotheses of the individual and lead him to reconsider some of them. The process of how the individual create new hypotheses will not be discussed in this manuscript (analogy, inference, induction, abduction, deduction...). What will be discussed is the conceptual nature of these hypotheses (see below).
</p>

<p>
	3. The &quot;experimental&quot; qualification of sciences like biology or physics is due to their ability to couple the &quot;pure thinking&quot; exercise of generating new hypotheses with interaction on the &quot;real&quot; system in order to test the validity of these new hypotheses. 
</p>



<p>
	The environment of the individual is made of multiple potential object of study. 

	The specification of the object of study induces a separation of the object from its own environment which may, or may not, include the individual. In developmental biology, the studied object is the embryo and the individual is excluded from the embryo's environment.
</p>









<h4>Exchange/Validation by the scientific community</h4>


<p>
	Even if the individual is at the center of experimental science, experimental science is a collective effort. The interaction with the scientific community operates bidirectionally.
</p>

<p>
	All the hypotheses the individual makes are build upon an accumulation of prior scientific works. He can access nearly all knowledge produced by the scientific community thanks to conferences or the various scientific papers databases (Pubmed, arXiv.org, IEEE, ACM, Google Scholar...).
</p>

<p>
	One particularity of science is that validation is made by the approval of the community of scientists. Through the peer-reviewed publication system, each new work is filtered before availability by a panel of individual representing the community. We may distinguish two kind of validation: the validation of the scientific work containing all or some parts of the elements mentionned in figure <a name='experimental_science_schematic' class='fig'></a>, and the validation of the hypotheses contained in the scientific work itself. We will develop the latter in the following (XXXXXX  see part III).
</p>

</figure>











<h3>Methodology augmented by tools</h3>


<p>

	Experimental science insists on the confrontation of the hypotheses, their consequences and the observation.

	This confrontation is improved by the means of tools. 

	Tools can be considered as the third actor in experimental science, in addition to the individual and the object of study.

</p>


recursive process

<p>
	They are also object of study by themselves. In developmental biology, the tools used to observe or perturb are themselves the focus of intensive ongoing research, from other fields of science. 
</p>

<p>
	The advances of our understanding are controlled by the advances of theses tools. Always improving microscopy increase the spatio-temporal resolution of the observations and every new microscope triggers a boom of conceptualization of these observations.
</p>

<p>
	The use of new physical tools drives methodological renewals. We will present an augmented version of the figure <a name='experimental_science_schematic' class='fig'></a> which introduces the methodology developed for this project. We distinguish the tools designed to augment the three fundamental processes of experimental science: tools to perceive, tools to conceive and tools to manipulate.
</p>









<h4>1. Tools to perceive</h4>


<p>
	Tools can improve the perception of the object of study, from the interfacing between the real system and the observed data, to the reconstruction of these data which extracts salient features in the observation.
</p>

<p>
	Perception-oriented tools are object whose aim is to produce measures of the object of study. Measures are quantification of the physical quantity of the object of study with ordinary real numbers. It may noted that if these tools add a significant objectivity in the measurement process, allowing interpretation free comparison between measures, the physical quantity <i>per se</i> are determined by the current knowledge and thereby are not are subject to interpretation.
</p>

<p>
	An improvement of the perception-oriented tools is the widening of the nature and scales of the physical quantity measured, accessing dimensions out of reach of the individual senses. 
	In developmental biology, optical devices allowed to reach the sub-cellular scale, sending photons to camera sensors with high spatial resolution. 
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes, perception-oriented tools must be coupled with experimentation to allow measurement. For example, the zebrafish, which has been selected in part for its transparent characteristic at early stages, is modified by injecting fluorescent-protein coding RNA to highlight some structure of the cells such as membranes, or nuclei when exposed to laser stimulation.
</p>

<p>
	The widening of scales induces the increasing of the size of generated data. This tendency is amplified by the coupling of measurement tools with automated recording with computers. When an embryo is measured under microscope device, the size of the data recorded is enormous. For a few hours of development, this measure, which is the spatio-temporally discriminated quantity of light emitted by a laser-excited fluorescent zebrafish, is composed of billions of values (for example, 200 3D-volume of voxels of light quantity obtained each 3 minutes, each volume having a resolution of 512x512x200, gives 10.48576 billions of values). This data size may also be multiply by the number of channel used for excitation (for example if both the cell nuclei and the cell membranes are captured). We call this microscope output data the 4D (3D + time) raw data set (or <i>raw data</i> for simplicity's sake). 
</p>

reconstruction needed

<p>
	This kind of extremely large data is not directly accessible by the individual. He can not gain biological insight from these raw data. Processing of the data is needed to allow interpretation and comparison with hypotheses. We call this processing <i>reconstruction</i> of the data. The reconstruction is a series of subprocesses organized as a <i>workflow</i>. Each subprocess does a specific task which extract some information from the input data sets and generate a new data set. Computers propose visualization software tools which allows the individual to create 2D movies of the captured developmental sequence. However, if a movie permits qualitative insights, it looses the quantitative measurement which would be used for comparison. A reconstruction which is useful for developmental biology question is extraction from the raw data of the lineage tree of captured cells. For a given cell at a given time step, this data set stores the identification number of the same cell at the previous time step. With the lineage tree, cells can be followed through time and, as cell divides during the embryo's development, and form diverging branches of the &quot;tree&quot;. In addition, complementary information can be stored for each cell at each time step: the 3D coordinates, the lists of neighbors, the quantity of captured protein signal, or ligand, or any fluorescent labeled molecules... The final data sets of the workflow compose the <i>reconstructed embryo</i>. It stores all the biologically relevant information contained in the raw data set at the cellular scale. 
</p>


<p>
	Some parts of the aforementioned reconstruction workflow can be realized with commercial softwares. However, the high number of cells involved and the difficulty to interpret and manipulate the 3D volume of data initiated the design of adapted softwares and the automation of most of these subprocesses. These tasks are the past and current results of the European project Bioemergences which developed a generic workflow of reconstruction of the lineage tree in vertebrate embryos. New specific modules has been developed for this project. The detailed presentation of the reconstruction workflow is done in chapter XXXXXXX.

<h4>2. Tools to conceive</h4>


part a: general definition

<p>
	Models or hypotheses aim at describing the whole picture of the studied phenomenon. They withdraw some supposed details and generalize the underlying mechanisms. They establish relations between the observed data.
</p>


means of expression constraints the models

<p>
	Models are constraint by their means of expression. The description of the structures and their interactions varies whether their are expressed through the verbal language, the graphical language or the mathematical language. There exists links between all these means of expression and models are often described through a combination of some of them.  
</p>

are we creating a new language for expressing ideas with computer simulation, interactive graphical language ?


classical/theoretical dichotomy

<p>
	In the context of developmental biology, a distinction is often expressed between &quot;classical&quot; studies and theoretical studies. 

	The former uses the verbal and graphical formalism, whereas the latter uses the mathematical formalism. 

	Structures are quantified by variables and their interactions are transformed into equations. 

	Generally, this formalism is expressed in &quot;analytical form&quot; as they use basic arithmetic operations (\(+\),\(-\),\(\times\),\(\div\)), <i>n</i>th roots, exponential, logarithm or infinite times series... Some variables have a special status as they are, by the hypotheses, supposed to remain constant in the modeled phenomenon: the parameters.

	Solving a system of equation means determining the set of variables that verify the system of equations.	
	In experimental science, the quantity involved tends to vary temporally and/or spatially, the rate or the derivative of the quantity is then used (i.e. the difference of quantity over an infinitesimal period of time and/or space). Equations comprising derivatives are called &quot;differential equations&quot;.


	The gain of theoretical studies is an increase of predictability of the hypotheses. 

	The consequence can be tested extensively, allowing to automatically reverse engineer the studied phenomenon. 

	This comes at the cost of a "simplification and an idealization, and consequently a falsification" (Turing <a name='Turing:1952vn' class='ref'></a>) of the description of the elements, which may perplexed "classical" biologists who are used to deal with the complexity of living systems. 
</p>




















<p>
	Either theoretical or &quot;classical&quot;, the role played by model remains invariant. However, theoretical models bring some advantages: 
</p>


<ul>
	<li>their formalized nature enables the design of precise experimental measures.</li>
	<li>their predictability allow to test new hypothesis by examining the consequences of unobserved phenomenon. </li>
	<li>they allow to integrate a wide range of observation. Without the help of formalization, the consequence of multiple interaction quickly become unpredictable by &quot;pure though&quot; experiment only. </li>
</ul>




specific vs general question answering

<p>
	To deepen the previous advantage, we may provide cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky's definition of model in his 1965's text &quot;Matter, mind and models&quot; <a name='Minsky:1965wb' class='ref'></a>:
</p>

<p>
	&quot;To an observer B, an object A* is a model of an object A to the extent that B can use A* to answer questions that interest him about A&quot;.
</p>

<p>
	This definition is centered around the notion of the question asked by the observer (or the individual in this text). It implies that any attempt of model type categorization should start by categorizing question type. Indeed, a distinction can be made between specific and general questions. In fundamental physics, the distinction is not so clear, as each specific question as generally massive repercussion on everything else. However, in biology, the gap is larger. As an example, we may cite the specific model which studies the shape of cells in a epithelium by Gibson et al. <a name='Gibson:2006gia' class='ref'></a>, as opposed to generic models aiming at simulating various developmental phenomena like Compucell <a name='Izaguirre:2004vr' class='ref'></a> <a name='Cickovski:2007tj' class='ref'></a> or Cellerator <a name='Shapiro:2001wu' class='ref'></a> <a name='Shapiro:2003je' class='ref'></a>. The former class asks a question then designs a model to answer it whereas the latter builds an integrative model before answering various potential questions. The latter class of models is proper to the theoretical category and, as we may show in the following, it is even part of a subcategory of theoretical models.
</p>

Theoretical models, analytical vs computer-simulated model


<p>
	As mentioned above, theoretical models formalize interactions with equation linking some selected variable of the studied phenomenon. The solving of these <i>analytical</i> formalization is not always doable because of constraint proper to mathematics. But computer is a tool that can help in the resolution of these equations, by converting them into algorithms. These <i>numerical</i> solutions, which are approximations of the idealistic solutions, are nowadays used in most fields of research or engineering. They allow scientists to tackle more complex phenomena observed. In 1952, Alan Turing already envisioned the use of computer to help him solve more realistic reaction-diffusion pattern in &quot;The chemical basis of morphogenesis&quot; <a name='Turing:1952vn' class='ref'></a>:
</p>

<p>
	&quot;Most of an organism, most of the time, is developing from one pattern into another, rather than from homogeneity into a pattern. One would like to be able to follow this more general process mathematically also. The difficulties are, however, such one cannot hope to have any very embracing theory of such process, beyond the statement of the equations. It might be possible, however, to treat a few particular cases in detail with the aid of a digital computer. This method has the advantage that it is not so necessary to make simplifying assumption as it is when doing a more theoretical type of analysis. &quot;
</p>


<p>
	Turing emphasizes the fact that the use of computer simulation is not only a practical solution for going over analytically unsolvable mathematical equation but also that it allows the individual to integrate mechanisms that he would refrain from using because of their mathematical unsolvability. In this sense, the computer (as a Turing machine) is a tool that augment the ability of the individual to develop mathematical models of the object of study.

</figure>



<p>
	In particular, a category of analytically unsolvable model is called the <i>many-boly problem</i>. It occurs when a large number of elements are interacting together. As we will present in section (XXXXXXX check), the physical approach we have chosen for our embryogenesis model is based on this assumption, each cell being an elementary particle interacting with its neighbors. Solving this system of equations is highly computationally intensive and requires the use of computers. Computers were originally invented to deal with theses situations (for example, the MonteCarlo simulation performed on the MANIAC computers in the early 1950s <a name='Metropolis:1987ws' class='ref'></a>).

rule out statistical models...

René: XXXX augmenter un peu cette partie en citant les différentes catégories: réseaux de neurones, machine learning, SVM

<p>
	A different kind of theoretical models are the statistical models from the data mining field. We rule out this category as they do not follow the individual-induced hypotheses framework. These models offer ways to simulate observed data without including <i>a priori</i> knowledge about these data. They possess predictive capacity but no explanatory value as the model produced is always a <i>black box</i> for the individual.
</p>






black box: no a priori information available, non causal, data-driven, empirical modeling

white box: a priori information, causal, rule between observation with coefficient -> parameters, theoretical modeling

gray box: most of the model are included in this one. The question of the validation

</p>

<ul>
	<li>&quot;holdout validation&quot;: the testing set and the training set are chosen randomly from the initial sample. Usually, 1/3 of the initial sample is used for the testing set. The error of prediction is estimated using the mean squared error (MSE).</li>
	<li>&quot;k-fold cross-validation&quot;: the initial sample is divided in k subsets. The holdout validation is performed with one subset as the testing set and the other k-1 subsets as the training set. The operation is repeated k times with a different testing set each time. The overall estimation of the error of prediction is obtained by averaging the k MSEs. </li>
</ul>














<h4>3. Tools to manipulate</h4>

<p>
	These tools are designed to modify the &quot;natural&quot; behavior of the object of study, or its environment, in a controlled manner. 

	These experiments are artificial construction allowing to discriminate the hypotheses ruling the behavior of the object of study. 

	In developmental biology, the embryo can be perturb either genetically or mechanically.
	Genetic experiments comprise embryo expressing abnormal phenotype either by random mutagenesis or by morpholino injection (knocking down of specific gene). 

	Mechanical experiments can be either lesion applied to some specific tissue to study their evolution (see laser ablation between individual cell-cell boundaries <a name='FernandezGonzalez:2009hp' class='ref'></a> <a name='Landsberg:2009bp' class='ref'></a>, or tissue dissection by laser <a name='Behrndt:2012gy' class='ref'></a> XXXXXXXXX find ref drosophila) or mechanical constraint to measure the response of the tissue.

	Mechanotranduction mechanism allow to conceive experiments at the border between genetics and mechanics (see genetic regulation by exerting a force with magnetic tweezer and magnetic nanoparticles <a name='Desprat:2008ei' class='ref'></a>).
</p>

Ajouter les manips in vitro qui permettent de controler l'environnement. (mais cependant on cherche souvent à reproduire des conditions in vitro qui ressemble le + possible aux conditions réelles ex: niche)

<p>
	As we will discover in section 2.2.1. (XXXXX), the study of object may require the  to study its part. In developmental biology, <i>in vitro</i> experiment allow to isolate cells or tissue, and test their behavior in controlled conditions (cell sorting experiment, ...). A pitfall is to underestimate the impact of the <i>in vitro</i> conditions on the behavior of the part, as they may behave differently from <i>in vivo</i> conditions. It leads to the design of <i>in vitro</i> environment which try to mimic the natural cellular &quot;niche&quot;, and not only in the study of stem cells <a name='Nishikawa:2007jl' class='ref'></a>.
</p>













separer le temps des autres variables... vouloir exprimer les autres variables en fonction du temps

<p>
	In classical mechanics, derived from the Newtonian laws, the &quot;time&quot; variable holds down a particular status. It is considered as an absolute, meaning that two events are temporally separated by an interval which is the same for all observers. This proposition is not correct in relativistic physics in which the notions of space and time are intermingled. However, the classical mechanics assumptions have funded a theoretical framework which produced accurate results for every situation which does not consider objects moving at a speed comparable to the speed of light (situations taken over by Relativistic mechanics) or objects whose size belong to the atomic or sub-atomic scale (situations taken over by Quantum mechanics). All the developmental biology models discussed in this manuscript fit into the classical framework. Moreover, development being a dynamical process, each variable has to be expressed as a function of time, whether it is taken as a discrete or continuous variable. 
</p>




...solve the model, produce set variable satisfying the equations...

<p>
	The output of a model is the record of the temporal evolution of its variable. We may sometimes call it the &quot;phenotype&quot;, or &quot;simulated phenotype&quot;, or &quot;simulated raw data&quot;, as most of the models presented in this manuscript are computer simulated. In classical mechanics, the phenotype is entirely determined by :
</p>

<ul>
	<li>the laws expressed in the model,</li>
	<li>its initial state: all variables including the parameters at the initial moment of the modeled phenomenon.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	We may take a simple example to picture this idea. If a ball is hit by an object, it will move into space though a parabolic curve until it lands the ground. A classical mechanics model of it would take the curve (i.e. the temporal evolution the position) as the phenotype and this curve is determined only from an initial known position and velocity of the ball. 
</p>









i
Solution -> 

validation -> checking if the experimentally observed set of variables belong to (or at least are closed to) this set.



Validated is the comparison of phenotype 
impossible directement ou tres difficile -> reconstruction




Improvement of the hypothesis are validated 




Before the discovery of quantum effects and other challenges to Newtonian physics, "uncertainty" was always a term that applied to the accuracy of human knowledge about causes and effects, and not to the causes and effects themselves.











<h3>Validation of the hypotheses</h3>






no true model

<p>
	The term <i>validation</i> of an hypotheses employed in this section can not be understood in the sense of stating that an hypothesis is true. 

	Oreskes et al. has demonstrated that establishing the truth of a proposition is possible only in a closed system and that models that used incompletely known input parameters as are models in developmental biology are never closed systems <a name='Oreskes:1994gn' class='ref'></a>. 

	Popper also advocates that one cannot prove theories and laws and that they can only be falsified <a name='Popper:1959uo' class='ref'></a>.

	The acceptation of the term <i>validation</i> must mean <i>consistency</i> between the output of the model and the observation of the object of study. The observations do support the probability of the model <a name='Oreskes:1994gn' class='ref'></a>, or its empirical adequacy <a name='vanFraassen:1980uy' class='ref'></a>.

</p>







plus on le confronte aux observations, plus il est acceptable

<p>
	The more observed data are positively confronted to the model, the more adequate it becomes. The diversity of the observed data is also a factor favoring the adequacy of the model.

	The observed reconstructed data evoked in the previous section are large data sets of various type.

	The strategy we adopt is to integrate the simulation platform and the reconstruction workflow. 

	It aims at evaluating the adequacy of the model with the assistance of all tools mentioned above. 

	This process of evaluation is equivalent to establishing the fitness of the data generated by the simulation and the observed data, by the means of <i>fitness function</i>.

</p>

2. comparer fitness

3. utilisation du workflow d'evaluation

mapping fitness sur espace des parametres

<p>
	We distinguish two types of fitness function in addition to the original cognitive fitness represented by the symbol \(\Delta\) in figure <a name='experimental_science_larger_augmented' class='fig'></a>:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		the automated fitness function category, denoted by the symbol \(\Delta_a\).  

		These functions require a reconstruction strategy from the data generated by the simulation platform similar to the reconstruction workflow described in the augmented perception part. 

		The simulated raw data are of a different kind than the experimental raw data. The first step of the new reconstruction workflow is to perform transformation of the simulated raw data to match the format of the reconstructed experimental data.

		This process is represented on figure <a name='experimental_science_larger_augmented' class='fig'></a>, the green dashed line represents the stage on both reconstruction workflow were both reconstructed data are of the same kind. 

		Once data format matches, it becomes possible to design automated <i>fitness function</i> to evaluate the discrepancy between both reconstructed data sets and give a quantitative score. 

	</li>
	<li>the visual fitness function category, denoted by the symbol \(\Delta_v\). 

		This category exists because of the visual aspect of the data. Each data can be visualized and the individual may intuitively dismissed some hypotheses based on the visualization only.
	</li>
</ul>



<p>
	An orthogonal dichotomy distinguish the fitness function whether the observed data which are matched with the simulated data are originated from:
</p>


	 
<ul>
	<li>
		the reconstruction of experimental raw data. These fitness function are called <i>experimental reconstruction fitness</i> (ERF) functions.
	</li>
	<li>
		theoretical data representing idealized phenotypic behavior. We denote theses fitness function by <i>theoretical fitness</i> (TF) functions.
	</li>
</ul>

on peut dire qu'il est plus probable mais on ne peut pas evaluer la probabitilé


However, situation of l'on montre qu'un modèle est meilleur qu'un autre car il est plus proche des observations










<p>
	The automated hypotheses evaluation strategies will be exploited in section 9 (XXXXXXchek) through a series of case studies. The general run of the strategy is to exhaustively map the parameter space with a fitness value in order to :

</p>

<ul>
	<li>assert the probability of the model to show that the hypotheses are sufficient to reproduce the observation in satisfying manner.</li>
	<li>discuss the topology of the map to find different mode of exploitation of the hypotheses.</li>
</ul>





experimental science, 2 levels of validation. 1. reproduce the observed data. 2. perturb (experimentally) the system in both reality and model and check if the match is still OK (if it does, we suppose that the model yields more generalized rules). 




two goals in mind: 
1 assert the probability of the model to show that the hypo are sufficient to reproduce the observation, 
2 suppose the model is valid, and reverse engineer the parameters


Les hypotheses du modele sont suffisantes pour produire les observations. dans la partie 1 de la validation...


	Moreover, if proving the necessity of the hypotheses is not possible, their sufficiency can at least be demonstrated. 

	This allows the computational testing of new hypotheses before further discriminating studies.

</p>


<p>
	&quot;Verification is the process of assessing software correctness and numerical accuracy of the solution to a given mathematical model. Validation is the process of assessing the physical accuracy of a mathematical model based on comparisons between computational results and experimental data. Verification and validation (V&V) are the primary processes for assessing and quantifying the accuracy of computational results. The perspective of V&V is distinctly on the side of skepticism, sometimes to the degree of being radical (Tetlock, 2005). In verification, the association or relationship of the simulation to the real world is not an issue. In validation, the relationship between the mathematical model and the real world (experimental data) is the issue.&quot;
</p>


<p>
	&quot;Blottner (1990) captured the essence of each in the compact expressions: “Verification is solving the equations right;” “Validation is solving the right equations.”&quot;
</p>

<p>
	&quot;When this viewpoint is carried to the extreme (Oreskes et al., 1994), one is left with the following position: one can only disprove or fail to disprove theories and laws of nature. Stated differently, theories and laws cannot be proved; they can only be falsified (Popper, 1969)&quot;
</p>


<p>
	&quot;During the last two decades a workable and constructive approach to the concepts, terminology, and methodology of V&V has been developed, but it was based on practical realities in business and government, not the issue of absolute truth in the philosophy of nature.&quot;
</p>


<p>
	&quot;Numerical algorithm verification is fundamentally empirical. &quot;
</p>


<p>
	Model validation: 
</p>


<p>
	aspect 1: &quot;Quantification of the accuracy of the computational model results by comparing the computed system response quantities (SRQs) of interest with experimentally measured SRQs.&quot;

<p>
	aspect 2: &quot;Use of the computational model to make predictions, in the sense of interpolation or extrapolation of the model, for conditions corresponding to the model’s domain of intended use.&quot;
</p>


<p>
	aspect 3: &quot;Determination of whether the estimated accuracy of the computational model results satisfies the accuracy requirements specified for the SRQs of interest.&quot;
</p>

<p>
	&quot;The three major types of model are conceptual, mathematical, and computational.&quot;
</p>

<p>
	&quot;Prediction: use of a computational model to foretell the state of a physical system under conditions for which the computational model has not been validated.&quot;
</p>

<p>
	&quot;Calibration: the process of adjusting physical modeling parameters in the computational model to improve agreement with experimental data.&quot;
</p>


<p>
	&quot;Calibration is primarily directed toward improving the agreement of computational results with existing experimental data, not determining the accuracy of the results.&quot;
</p>

<p>
	&quot;if one examines a complete system, it is found that some elements of the validation hierarchy involved calibration and some are focused on validation.&quot;

</p>

from the laws of symbolic logic, &quot;it is impossible to demonstrate the truth of any proposition, except in a closed system.&quot; The models are never closed systems, in part because their input parameters are incompletely known (ex. hydrogeology, geochemistry), or because information is lost between the lower scale and the averaging scale (continuum mechanics), or because so unavailable data force effect to be neglected, or because assumption are approximative at some level...

&quot;However one chooses to ignore mechanics, nevertheless, presiding over every embryonic twitch and jerk are Newton’s laws. And whatever role chemistry and genetics play in embryogenesis, they must finally submit their programs for Newtonian execution. Therefore, we have adopted the philosophy that, since morphogenesis is—at least proximally—a mechanical event, it is reasonable to start analyses of morphogenetic processes by examining the forces that produced them, and then, working backwards, add chemistry and genetics as needed.&quot;
