<h2>2.1. Theoretical biology models of development  </h2>
 
 






<p>
	Even if some of the authors cited in the previous section were involved in theoretical research (for example Waddington, Needham and others founded the &quot;Theoretical Biology Club&quot; in 1930), most of the production was provided by &quot;classical&quot; biologists. In the following sections, we will present a state of the art of the theoretical studies in developmental biology.
</p>












<p>
	<strong>History</strong>
</p>




<p>
	Nicolas Rashevsky, among the fathers of theoretical biology. 

	He aims at formalizing biology with mathematics. Call its discipline &quot;Mathematical Biophysics&quot;. (Rashevsky, N., 1938. Mathematical Biophysics <a name='Rashevsky:1938tf' class='ref'></a>).
	
	He made the first attempt to describe quantitatively biological phenomena. 

	He insists on maintaining proximity between theoreticians and experimentalists.
</p>


<p>
	Some said that he produced &quot;neither good mathematics nor good biology nor good physics&quot;. (from Cull, P., 2007. The mathematical biophysics of Nicolas Rashevsky. Biosystems, 88(3), pp.178–184. <a name='Cull:2007ib' class='ref'></a>)... interesting since the beginning of quantitative biology, this critisism plagues the interdisciplinarity...
</p>


<p>
	on development: he proposes a framework to describe organisms as graph with vertices representing biological functions and oriented edges relating the interactions between them. Rashevsky, N., 1954. Topology and life: in search of general mathematical principles in biology and sociology. Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, 16(4), pp.317–348. <a name='Rashevsky:1954ws' class='ref'></a>
</p>



<p>
	also: Rashevsky, N., 1940. An approach to the mathematical biophysics of biological self-regulation and of cell polarity. Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, 2(1), pp.15–25. <a name='Rashevsky:1940uc' class='ref'></a>: cell polarity is possible even if the cell has a spherical shape. 
</p>


Look for the first major developmental model involving mechanics: 

-> the equations of continuum mechanics

cells as interacting members of a deformable medium

different from Odell et al. who uses discrete cells.

Nature 442: 1038–1041. <a name='Gibson:2006gia' class='ref'></a> used a <i>Markov chain model</i> to explain the evolution of the distribution of cell shape in a <i>Drosophila</i> epithelium. The authors propose that cell proliferation, and not cell packing, is responsible for the shaping of cells in monolayered epithelia. The model is compared with various organisms data. (for <a name='Oates:2009kg' class='ref'></a>, an example of a "top-down" model: no parameters are needed.) </li>

A vertex based model is used where each vertex represents the junction. Forces are derived from an energy function which takes into account cell elasticity, cortical tension and inter cell adhesion. The model is tested with laser ablation experimental data. </li>

Argument that any attempt to improve biological plausibility of this model (3 sided cells, asynchronous division) induces a deviation from the &quot;universal&quot; histogram. &quot;We conclude from these results that attempts to improve the non-spatial model by adding biological realism are futile, and that the excellent agreement of the GPNP model with experimental data appears to be serendipitous&quot;(!!!). 2. They show that their geometrical epithelium model (with ScEM) predict the histogram with the only sensible parameter being growth rate. 3.

reformuler le texte suivant from Mechanical control at cell–cell contacts

Cell adhesion and cortex tension are known to regulate cell–cell contact formation. Heisenberg, Paluch and colleagues now analyse the contributions of cell adhesion and cortex tension in contact formation and sorting of zebrafish progenitor cells (Science http://doi.org/jcp; 2012).

Building on previously published models of cell–cell adhesion and sorting, the authors developed a theoretical description of the shape of two progenitor cells adhering to each other. They then used dual micropipette aspiration assays to separate adhering progenitor cells from zebrafish embryos ex vivo and determined that cortex tension controls interfacial tension at the cell–cell contact, and thereby regulates cell–cell contact expansion. In contrast, cell adhesion was not involved in determining cell–cell contact size. Instead, the authors demonstrated that following mechanical separation of adhering cells, the linkage of cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton was crucial in limiting the mechanical resistance of adhesive bonds to pulling forces. The cytoskeletal anchoring of cadherins was further shown to be important for correct progenitor cell sorting within cell aggregates in vitro, and also during the segregation of progenitor cells in gastrulating zebrafish embryos in vivo. Thus, by combining theoretical, biophysical and live imaging experiments, the authors showed that cell adhesion is necessary to mechanically couple the cortices of adhering cells to support cell sorting.

Development, 139(4), pp.625–639. <a name='Oates:2012kv' class='ref'></a>: The discovery of the segmentation clock, an oscillating genetic network in the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM), leading the formation of somites in the elongating body axis of vertebrate embryo is the source of an active field of theoretical modeling. The phenomenon is conserved in various species and it illustrates the interplay of inner cell regulation and cell-cell communication. Cooke and Zeeman introduced a general mechanism called the &quot;clock and wavefront&quot; mechanism which has intensively been studied since its introduction in 1976 <a name='Cooke:1976uf' class='ref'></a>. Lacking molecular grounding, it predicts the number and size of the somites from the period of the clock and the velocity of a wave travelling from the anterior to the posterior part of the axis, locking the cellular oscillators and forming a fixed periodic pattern. From then on, multiple oscillating genes, ie genes whose encoding protein and RNA follow cyclic creation and degradation, have been discovered in various species: Delta/Notch, Wnt, FGF, Hes/Her, and multiple models have been proposed to explain their interactions.</li>

In addition to the posteriorly moving molecular gradient which slows the rate of the segmantation clock oscillations, the authors propose that ocillator coupling may also induce a slowing of the oscillations. Using a continuum model of oscillators, an emergent wavefront is produced with three parameters: the clock period in the PSM, the somite length, the length of the PSM. Their model predicts the distance between moving shapes of gene expression, the number of moving stripes and the oscillating period profile along the antero-posterior axis. It also states that the ratio of coupling strength explains interspecies variability and that the period profile is conserved along the antero-posterior axis.

	<i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> is a kind of amoeba whose life cycle goes through various episodes. Initially, the unicellular amoebae are sporulated by a mature fruiting body. They divide until they lack the bacteria they feed on. The starvation triggers a phase of aggregation leading to the formation of a multicellular slug which is able to move toward attractants like light, heat or humidity. The migration stops when the slug

<h4>Levels of organization  </h4>
 


<p>
	&quot;Materialism&quot; or &quot;Physicalism&quot; have different historical roots but today, they have equivalent meaning. They states that everything in the natural world is physical and conforms to the action of physical matter. 
</p>

<p>
	Until today, the study of how organisms develop themselves has the luck to deal with a category of objects that:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>scale larger than atoms so it avoids the fundamental challenge of quantum physics ("&quot;The ontology of materialism rested upon the illusion that the kind of existence, the direct "actuality" of the world around us, can be extrapolated into the atomic range. This extrapolation is impossible, however.&quot; from Heisenberg, W., 1958. Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science, Harper amp;rothers Publishers. <a name='Heisenberg:1958vp' class='ref'></a>)</li>
	<li>move significantly slower than the speed of light so the relativity theory is not necessary,</li>
	<li>occurs before the apparition of any &quot;mental&quot; activities so the dualist-materialist debate on consciousness is out of the scope.</li>
</ul>
	 
<p>
	It follows that the classical materialistic view is a consensual one to study development. 
</p>

<p>
	Our understanding of matter has spawned various categories which can by classified into a hierarchical level (see figure <a name='leveloforganization_circle' class='fig'></a>). The smaller level is the one of subatomic particles which can be organized into atoms. The atoms arrange themselves into molecules which is the smaller relevant scale for development. Molecules interacts to form macromolecules and then organelles. These objects structure the basic unit of life: the cell which is again organized as tissues, tissues compose the organs and organs constitute the organisms. Again, organisms have social interactions which fund populations, then communities, ecosystem, and finally the biosphere which end the pyramid for this categorization of the living (but we could still zoom out if we were interested in more inanimate matter through planets, solar systems, galaxies... ). 
</p>

<p>
	Each level of organization is defined by its elements which share some similar structural or functional properties.
</p>

<p>
	Each element is made of a collection of subelements. The "made of" element is denoted by the macroscopic qualification and the subelements are described as the microscopic elements. 
</p>

<p>
	This principle of composition is transitive, a microscopic element can be considered macroscopic when it is considered itself as composed of subelements. The dichotomy micro/macro stands if two levels are considered (see figure XXXX). If three nested levels are considered, the intermediary level may be called mesoscopic level (see figure XXXX). Practically, theoretical models rarely consider more than two levels of organization.

	discussion reductionnist / non-reductionnist (emergence)


Among materialists, a fundamental distinction exists between the upholder and the opponents of the reductionist approach.

reductionnist: embryo is nothing but the sum of its parts (cells) during its developmental phase of existence as it is not interacting with its environment, too isolated (contrary to the organism with evolution)

non-reductionnist: cells are more than the sum of its parts, we define than as the microscopic elements in our studies and we use emergent rules for their behavior.

<p>
	Physicist Richard Feynman once declared that &quot;If we were to name the most powerful assumption of all, which leads one on and on in an attempt to understand life, it is that all things are made of atoms, and that everything that living things do can be understood in terms of the jigglings and wigglings of atoms&quot; <a name='Feynman:1964tu' class='ref'></a>. 
</p>


<p>
	Feynman epitomizes the reductionist view that implies that the behavior of any living things can be explained only by the interaction of its parts. 
	This approach induces a <i>bottom-up</i> acceptance of the causality.
</p>





non-red.

<p>
	Following the words of Aristotle, &quot;the whole is <i>more</i> than the sum of its parts&quot;, the non-reductionists claim that the understanding would come from intermediary conceptual structure adapted to the studied phenomenon (see Anderson, P.W., 1972. More is different. Science. <a name='Anderson:1972wi' class='ref'></a>). 
	This principle is called &quot;emergence&quot; and it justifies the existence of scientific fields, ranging from biology to sociology, which are not just temporary substitution to physics but relevant discipline as they expose interactions that physics would be unable to formalize. 
</p>



This view does not contradict the bottom-up causality but soften it. Instead of starting from the smaller part conceived (atoms or even subatomic particles), bottom-up causality could be applied to these intermediary structures.

hard and soft red version?



	Our personal approach is that Feynman is right, every living being behavior can be understood in terms of atomic behavior. However, the enormity of the number of atoms and their interactions make &quot;understanding&quot; impossible by a human being. Humans may rely on evolution to improve their current abilities, but a safer bet would be to rely on the ever-increasing computational power of computers. This would not solve the issue of understanding as computers do not understand, but at least the behavior of living things could be reproduced. Rephrasing Feynman: computer simulation allows that everything that living things do can be &quot;reproduced&quot; in terms of the jigglings and wigglings of &quot;simulated&quot; atoms.

<h4>Scaling up the laws  </h4>
 




	


<p>
	The multilevel approach offers an alternative to the classical formalization of problem. Instead of using a single equation ruling the behavior of a system at the macroscopic level, one can simulate the interaction of the element at the microscopic level and observe the result of the simulation.
</p>

<p>
	Traditionnaly, in physics, the process of deciphering the macroscopic law from the microscopic elements interactions, that we will call &quot;upscaling&quot;, was possible by means of averaging tools of statistics (see statistical physics). These approximating methods use probability theory and necessitate to verify precise criteria at the microscopic level, notably criteria of number and homogeneity of microscopic elements. Theses methods shift the discrete paradigm of the microscopic elements behavior toward the continuous paradigm of the acroscopic law. 

	The point we want to emphasize is that this process is an approximation process which, <i>per se</i> is error inducing. When the studied matters are homogeneous, like most of the sytem studied in physics are, the approximation stands (but can also be discussed as Goldenberg and Goldhirsch showned in their derivation of continuum mechanics equations from microscopics particles properties <a name='Goldenberg:2008wq' class='ref'></a>), but in biological systems, heterogeneity is such that probability theories are not applicable. 

	Once again, the solution may come from computer science, and in particular from the use of agent-based models (ABM).

<p>
	Paraphrasing Feynman again, the developing organism can be explain in terms of the jigglings and wigglings of its cells.
</p>

<p>
	One can note that the dichotomy between macroscopic/continuous laws and agent-based models is more important conceptually than practically. Numerical methods used to solve continuous macroscopic law with computer discretize both space and time (finite element simulation, ...) and ressemble multi-agent simulation.

intersting hybrid solution

<p><strong>Hybrid Multiscale Models</strong></p>

<p>Many mathematical models of biological process that consider space explicitly, fal into one of two categories: continuum population models or discrete individual based models. Discrete, stochastic interactions between individual organisms cannot be captured by the continuum approach and likewise global population interactions cannot be captured by the discrete approach (my opinion, pas d'accord...). In recent years a third category of models has emerged: hybrid models which allow modellers to exploit the advantages of both continuum and discrete models. (comes from Anderson)</p>

<h4>Specialization of the laws  </h4>
 



<p>
	In developmental biological systems, three levels of organization are considered: the sub-cellular level, where the individual elements are molecules, the cellular level and the organism's level. 
</p>

<p>
	A &quot;hard&quot; reductionist approach would lead to skip the intermediary cellular level and describe the organism's behavior in terms of molecular interactions. This tempting approach strikes against two obstacles:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>the theoretical models of molecular interactions may not be adapted for such tasks,</li>
	<li>the available computational power is far from satisfying the need anyway (in 2010, molecular interactions composed of a few ten thousands atoms took 1 day of computation for 20 ns of realtime simulation <a name='Buch:2010iq' class='ref'></a>). </li>
</ul>

<p>
	Upscaled laws discussed above have to be used. Before enumerating the possible laws used in developmental biology modeling, another clarification about the upscaling process have to discussed. Upscaling process is not only an approximation process and it is also a selection process. The macroscopic behaviors describe by upscaled laws are often focusing a limited set of features of the level of organization. For exemple, from a microscopic molecular level, macroscopic laws describing the thermodynamic, the metabolic, the genetic, the diffusive, the chemical or the mechanical feature properties of the cell can be inferred. These laws all have their own domain of application.
</p>


<p>
	So developmental biology modeling does not only have to select the adapted level of organization, but also which specific laws will be used and eventually how theses laws will be coupled. Two main families of macroscopic properties are often considered in developmental biology modeling: the ones describing the biomechanical properties and the ones describing the molecular signaling and the genetic regulation. 
</p>

<p>
	Each family are represented at the molecular level by different kind of molecules:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		the molecules related to mechanics. Most important members of this family are the molecules which form the cytoskeleton (actin, myosin, microtubules, microfilaments) and adhesion related molecules which tight the neighbor cell together (cadherins). Even if most molecules do not have biomechanical related properties, the ensemble of all molecules composing a cell define the viscoelastic properties just by filling the cellular volume.
	</li>
	<li>
		the molecules related to molecular signaling and genetic regulation....
	</li>

	Existing submodels addressing specific subcomponent mechanisms of somitogenesis have improved our understanding at individual scales and between scales, creating the impression that we are converging on a comprehensive understanding of somitogenesis. We have no assurance, however, that existing submodels are consistent and integrable with one another, or that, combined, they suffice to explain somitogenesis in toto.

Discussion sur les causes et les consequences, privilégiant les forces et non les genes comme explications du developpement dans Odell, G.M. et al., 1981. The mechanical basis of morphogenesis. I. Epithelial folding and invagination. Developmental Biology, 85(2), pp.446–462. <a name='Odell:1981vy' class='ref'></a>


&quot;Our model, therefore, is built on Newton's laws of notion and consists of a dynamical system of ordinary differential equations whose solution determines the global time history of the cell sheet geometry, given its initial configuration. Thus our "explanation" of how !pithelial morphogenesis proceeds rests on solving the nechanical equations of motion based on the balance )f cell-generated forces. That is, we view cell forces, not :locks, morphogens, or potentials, as the "cause" which 'explains" the morphogenetic motion. We hope that the ogical extension of this model will be to generate a ~eries of hypotheses on the molecular basis for reor- ~anizationo f contractile proteins inside the cell which would explain the phenomenological rules defined in ;his paper.&quot;

-> notre position, ce débat est du a la séparation "artificielle" mecha et gen, au niveau moleculaire pas de probleme de cause...
