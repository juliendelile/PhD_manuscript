<p>
	General : &quot;In zebrafish, the first mesendodermal progenitors are induced at the margin of the blastoderm when the blastoderm starts to spread over the yolk cell (dome stage) (for reviews, see Kimelman and Schier, 2002; Warga and Stainier, 2002). When the blastoderm covers about half of the yolk cell (50% epiboly), the germ ring forms as a local thickening at the margin of the blastoderm. Germ ring formation is accompanied by convergence movements of blastodermal cells, leading to a compaction of cells at the dorsal side of the germ ring, where the embryonic organizer or ‘shield’ forms (Warga and Kane, 2003). This is also the time, when mesendodermal progenitors within the germ ring begin to internalize by moving first to the margin of the blastoderm, then downwards in direction of the yolk sac and eventually migrating back towards the animal pole of the gastrula (Warga and Kimmel, 1990).&quot; Montero, J.-A. et al., 2005. Shield formation at the onset of zebrafish gastrulation. Development, 132(6), pp.1187–1198. <a name='Montero:2005kq' class='ref'></a>
</p>



<p>
	# Internalization mode
</p>


<p>
	Ingression (dorsal ?) vs involution (ventral ?), border or continuous between two modes
</p>


<p>
	Two questions :
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Q1. intra-internalizing tissue motility (involution vs ingression)</li>
	<li>Q2. if ingression, are internalizing cells mixed (intermingled) with non-internalizing cells or is there a clear cut ?</li>
</ul>


<p>
	&quot;<i>Involution</i> is the flowing of a sheet of cells over the edge of an inpocketing, where invagination has occured, such as at the blastopore during amphibian gastrulation.&quot; (Trinkaus, J.P., 1996. Ingression during early gastrulation of fundulus. Developmental Biology, 177(1), pp.356–370. <a name='Trinkaus:1996ju' class='ref'></a>): trinkaus does not consider fundulus to perform &quot;classical involution&quot; as does the Amphibia. Involution is associated with the internalization of cohesive sheet of cells in opposition to <i>ingression</i> which concerns &quot;individuals or small clusters of individuals&quot; which &quot;sink inside as individuals, changing their relations to each other in the process&quot;. The motility pattern is different. In the involuting tissue, there is no internal topological rearrangement between the cells. Ingressing cells have higher topological rearrangement and may even be mixed with non-internalizing tissue.
</p>

<p>
	Whether the term <i>involution</i> is suited in zebrafish or not, we use it as an archetypic description which characterizes the motion of a collective sheet of cell plunging toward the yolk mass and turning back toward the animal pole.
</p>

<p>
	Q1. ingression Q2. cell-autonomous. in (Carmany-Rampey, A. amp;chier, A.F., 2001. Single-cell internalization during zebrafish gastrulation. Current biology : CB, 11(16), pp.1261–1265. <a name='CarmanyRampey:2001uy' class='ref'></a>): uses MZoep mutants which do no internalize at all. When MZoep mutant cells are transplanted to the margin of wild-type embryos, the internalization appears to happen normally but they do not migrate towards the animal pole. (mon avis, ça peux potentiellement arriver aussi chez le WT). The vice-versa transplantation would make the transplanted WT cell internalize propertly and form a mesendodermal marker expressing tissue + &quot;Interestingly, in MZoep embryos the wild-type cells internalized by directly moving deep toward the yolk without first moving to the most vegetal region of the margin, as in wild-type embryos.&quot; (on pourrait aussi imaginer que cette ingression individuelle n'est pas dû à une motilité intrinseque des cellules plongeantes mais que les cellules plongeantes sont éjectées vers le yolk par les cellules epiblastiques qui s'intercalent. Pour tester ça, on pourrait imaginer une transplantation de MZoep dans un mutant qui stoppe l'intercalation radial (hab?) et observer si les cellules ingressent quand meme -> si non, bingo !!)
</p>

Development, 132(6), pp.1187–1198. <a name='Montero:2005kq' class='ref'></a>): internalizing cells delaminate as single cells within more than&quot; 4-5 cell diameters away from the tip of the germ ring&quot;.

<p>
	Q1. Involution in (D'Amico, L.A. amp;ooper, M.S., 2001. Morphogenetic domains in the yolk syncytial layer of axiating zebrafish embryos. Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists, 222(4), pp.611–624. <a name='DAmico:2001ic' class='ref'></a>): suggest that ingression is not the dominant mode of internalization. reason -> 4D confocal imaging of fluorescent-dextran labeled cells internalizing in the dorsal marginal zone were observed, &quot;98% of the cells entered the hypoblast within approximately three cell diameters from the edge of the margin.&quot; 70/114 entered the hypoblast within a 1 cell diameter from the margin. (not so convincing... the same argument is used to draw opposite conclusion in Montero, J.-A. et al., 2005. Shield formation at the onset of zebrafish gastrulation. Development, 132(6), pp.1187–1198. <a name='Montero:2005kq' class='ref'></a>: &quot;Notably, all of the prechordal plate progenitor cells – out of the 70 epiblast cells we analyzed in dorsal/axial of the germ ring – delaminated not more than 4-5 cell diameters away from the tip of the germ ring; this indicates that prechordal plate progenitor cell internalization is restricted to the marginal-most region of the germ ring&quot;) </p>

<h3>Post-internalization : Epiboly (phase 2) and Convergence-Extension (CE)</h3>




1. Decrire les mouvements cellulaires (cinématiques)

<p>
	Once internalization is over, three distinct blastoderm populations co-exist: the endoderm and the mesoderm form the hypoblast, and the ectoderm.
</p>


<ul>
	<li>the endoderm forms a mono-layer of highly motile mesenchymal cells. </li>
	<li>the mesoderm is regionalized in three distinct sub-population: the notochord, the paraxial mesoderm and the prechorale plate.</li>
	<li>the ectoderm which will also be differentiated in two sub-populations, the neural ectoderm in the dorsal region and the non-neural ectoderm in the ventral region.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	In addition, the YSL (iYSL eYSL), YCL ..., and the extra cellular matrix (ECM)...
</p>

<p>
	As a rough approximation, all tissues move in a similar fashion. They spread over the yolk toward the vegetal pole (epiboly) and they converge toward the dorsal side of the embryo to form the antero-posterior axis (convergence-extension). 
</p>





2. Explications mecaniques

<p>
	However, the detailed observation of the different tissue kinematics reveals that each tissue has specificities (XXXX citer papier etudes deplacement) and their mechanical action may be different to perform the gastrulation movement.

	
</p>



<p>
	This study is funded on the notion that a tissue have a specific mechanical behavior and it deforms according to the following processes:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>by actively exerting forces on its environment. Only the external cells of the tissue are active and they actively interact with cells belonging to neighbor tissue.</li>
	<li>by passively undergoing forces exerted by the neighbor cells on its external layer. This is the counterpart of the first scenario.</li>
	<li>by actively performing mechanical action <i>within</i> its domain. In this case, cells belonging to the same tissue interact with each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Unfortunately for our understanding, the most likely hypothesis is the one which combines multiple processes depending on the cell types.
</p>

<p>
	The usage of perturbed embryos (transgene, mutants or mechanical perturbations) allow to discriminate the relative action of the different tissues by impairing the action (or the existence) of some tissue and observe the consequence for the all gastrulation.
</p>

<h4>The <i>surface gel layer hypothesis</i></h4>



blastoderm and its unlerlying syncytial layer, the periblast

periblast = iYSL see p.277 a name='Trinkaus:1951ue' 

yolk gel layer hypothesis -> not tenable

surface gel layer -> external layer



*The term “surface gel layer” is synonymous with “superficial gel layer”
(Lewis), “pellicle,” (Devillers), and “surface coat” (Holtfreter). It must be
emphasized that, in spite of the static terminology generally in use for membranes
at the cell surface, one must clearly recognize their essentially dynamic
state. The capacity to rapidly heal wounds and complex relations to ionic
transport by such membranes provide ample evidence on this point.





<p>
	The first hypothesis explaining the epiboly in teleost was proposed by J.P. Trinkaus in 1951 <a name='Trinkaus:1951ue' class='ref'></a>. He ruled out the hypotheses that epiboly is due to differential growth mechanisms or by a contractile activity of the yolk surface (<i>yolk gel layer hypothesis</i>). He favors the hypothesis that the then denominated <i>periblast</i> (now internal yolk syncytial layer iYSL), is responsible for the cell <i>mass movements</i>. 
</p>

<p>
	This hypothesis mainly relies on microdissection experiments where all blastoderm are removed, leaving the periblast exposed. In those cases, the periblast still complete epiboly until closure of the blastopore.
</p>

<p>
	Later studies <a name='Trinkaus:1967uz' class='ref'></a> <a name='Trinkaus:1984wu' class='ref'></a> confirmed this insight and settle the YSL as the driving force of Fundulus' epiboly. 

	Colchicine treatment of the Fundulus gastrulae impaired the deep cells mechanical properties and yet the epiboly still performed normally <a name='Trinkaus:1983bm' class='ref'></a>. This leads the notion that deep cells is not responsible for the late epiboly (&quot;Epiboly of Fundulus, and presumably of teleosts generally, does not depend on the deep cells.&quot; <a name='Trinkaus:1984wu' class='ref'></a>). 

	

</p>




When
Fundulus gastrulae are treated with colchicine,
cytokinesis and much movement
of deep cells are inhibited, grossly interfering
with their morphogenetic movements
(Trinkaus and Erickson, 1983),
nevertheless epiboly proceeds normally to
completion. Epiboly of the whole blastoderm
depends ratner on epiboly of the
enveloping layer, which, in turn, seems to
depend on the yolk syncytial layer, with the
cooperation of the diminishing yolk cytoplasmic
layer.  


The deep cells participate in
epiboly, to be sure, moving in directed ways
between the I-YSL and EVL, constantly
filling new submarginal space as it is added,
but they do not play a causal role.

{Trinkaus:1984wu}



<p>
	The distance between the margin YSNs and the marginal blastoderm increases as the YSNs and the EVL cells starts their post internalization epibolic movement before the deep cells. 
</p>


<p>
	Supposing that the deep cells are not responsible for this increase, and thus to the epibolic movement at least just after internalization, multiple scenario may explain the movement of the margin. 
</p>


<p>
	All scenarii involve a strong cohesion of the YSL and the EVL at the margin, such as the tight junctions described by <a name='Betchaku:1978hm' class='ref'></a>. They differ in their causal explanation of the mechanism responsible for the vegetal-oriented motion of the margin.

# Microtubules role during late epiboly


<p>
	Describe microtubule structure during late epiboly as Solnica...
</p>


<p>
	During the deep cells internalization, the YSNs and their microtubule network appear below the rim of the EVL cells <a name='SolnicaKrezel:1994wl' class='ref'></a>.
</p>


At
50% epiboly, the blastoderm margin arrives at the equator of
the embryo and deep cells engage in the gastrulation
movements of involution and convergence (Kimmel and
Warga, 1990). At this stage blastoderm cells almost completely
covered the YSN and the associated microtubule network. The
YCL microtubules emerged from below the rim of EVL cells
(Figs 5E,F, 1C).
The initial stages of gastrulation are correlated with a
transient cessation of epiboly by deep cells (Warga and
Kimmel, 1990). Consequently, after formation of the
embryonic shield, when the EVL covered approximately 65%
of the yolk cell, the deep cells lagged in epibolic movements
(Fig. 5A,C). At this stage, the YSN, surrounded by their
microtubule network, reemerged from below the EVL rim
around the circumference of the embryo and populated up to
70% of the yolk cytoplasm (Figs 5A, 1D). Some of the nuclei
of the external YSL exhibited variable, elongated shapes (Fig.
5A,B). The YSL microtubules surrounded the nuclei forming
basket-like arrangements (Fig. 5B,C). The expansion of the
YSN and their associated microtubule network, and the
apparent shortening of the YCL microtubules continued until
the YSL and the blastoderm covered the entire yolk cell (data
not shown).

	To our knowledge, there is no hypothesis involving an active spreading of the iYSL due to the microtubule network.

</p>




<h4>Active evl intercalation</h4>



Furthermore, the EVL undergoes active cell rearrangements during epiboly. Some of the leading edge cells leave the margin and intercalate amongst more animal cells, and other cells constrict while others become wider (Keller and Trinkaus, 1987; Köppen et al., 2006; Zalik et al., 1999). This indicates that the EVL is not a totally passive component of epiboly.

</p>


<p>

<p>
	Actomyosin contraction in the YSL induces EVL cell shape changes <a name='Koppen:2006fy' class='ref'></a>, correlating with margin contraction.
</p>


<p>
	Filopodial activity has been observed on the apicolaterl surfaces of the EVL cells at the EVL - eYSL interface. Theses microspike-like structures suggests that EVL may have an active behavior at the margin <a name='Zalik:1999tx' class='ref'></a>.

<p>

	EVL cells do not perform large-scale rearrangements during epiboly  (look for ref...)

	"As epiboly progresses, nuclei progressively recede from the advancing margin of the epibolic YSL. However, a small group of nuclei is retained at the YSL margin to form a constricting blastoporal ring." (D'Amico, L.A. &amp; Cooper, M.S., 2001.

</p>




<h4>Endocytosis in the external YSL</h4>



<p>
	Endocytosis has been observed in Fundulus just below the advancing margin of the blastoderm <a name='Betchaku:1978hm' class='ref'></a>. It occurs only in the eYSL. However, the possibility that it plays an active role in the epiboly of the margin is impaired as the endocytic vesicles do not integrate the surface of the iYSL but rather move vegetally toward the bottom of the eSYL <a name='Betchaku:1986tw' class='ref'></a>. It can not contribute to the expansion of the iYSL surface.
</p>

<p>
	In zebrafish, the endocytotic process was observed even if in the absence of YSL microtubules <a name='SolnicaKrezel:1994wl' class='ref'></a>)

<h4>A friction force induced by a retrograde flow in the eYSL</h4>


<p>

Science, 338(6104), pp.257–260. <a name='Behrndt:2012gy' class='ref'></a> hypothesizes the existence of an additional previously undescribed force that would pull the EVL-yolk margin vegetally by a flow-friction mechanism. This mechanism is shown to be sufficient to drive epithelial epiboly after 50%-epiboly because, in mechanically constrained cylindrical embryos, where a purse-string scenario is inefficient, the margin is still converging to the vegetal pole. An undiscussed hypothesis would also be sufficient to reproduce these observations is the possibility that the epiblast radial intercalation could explain the persistent epiboly in cylindrical embryos. (we should image that, if the epiblast is closed to the margin, the flow-friction force is challenged XXXX).
</p>















<h4>Blastoderm driving late epiboly </h4>









<p>
	Even if microtubules are disrupted by nocodazole treatment, deep cells and EVL still performs partial epiboly whereas YSN stay in the 40% region. (Solnica-Krezel, L., 1994.

</p>



<p>
	Epiblast deep cells intercalate radially from interior layer to the sub-evl layer. They change their shape to actively drive the epiboly. An E-cadherin mutant, half-baked (hab), expressed in a radial gradient in the non axial epiblast, induce cell phenotype that do no maitain their intercalated position and "de-intercalate" toward their previous interior layer.

<p>
	&quot;Starting during the mid-gastrula stage, YSL nuclei initiate long-range convergent-extension movements toward the dorsal midline (see Figs. 6, 7). Concurrently, there is an extension in the AP direction of the YSL nuclei that either reside in, or enter, the dorsal region. This convergence and extension pattern is intriguing because it is achieved in a syncytial cell that has no boundaries between the individual nuclei. It seems likely that the extensive microtubule arrays that interlink YSL nuclei (Solnica-Krezel and Driever, 1994) play a key role in driving nuclear movements. The movements of YSL nuclei have many similarities to the movements of the overlying deep cells of the blastoderm. It is important to consider whether or not YSL and deep cell movements are independent of each other. The YSL surface serves as a substrate for the crawling of hypoblast cells and, thus, may have some influence on the direction that cells migrate on this surface. The YSL influence on cell migrations may be especially true for the large flat endodermal cells that closely associate with the YSL surface (Warga and Nu¨ sslein-Volhard, 1999). Epiboly of the blastoderm has been shown to be at least partially dependent on the normal epiboly of the YSL (Trinkaus, 1984b; Stra¨hle and Jesuthasan, 1993; Solnica-Krezel and Driever, 1994; Kane et al., 1996; Zalik et al., 1999).&quot;
</p>


<p>
	&quot;An alternative hypothesis is that the motility of deep cells in the blastoderm is responsible for directing the YSL nuclear movements. Is it possible that cells migrating on the surface of the YSL could somehow drag YSL nuclei with them, even though the plasma membrane of the yolk cell physically separates them? Although it is formally plausible that a bulk flow of YSL membrane and YSL cytoplasm could be generated by migrating cells collectively pulling the YSL membrane, this theoretical possibility is unsupported by numerous observations. Previous studies have shown that deep cells migrate individually, in different directions, and independently of underlying YSL nuclei (Warga and Kimmel, 1990; Solnica-Krezel and Driever, 1994; Wilson et al., 1995; Trinkaus, 1996; Warga and Nu¨ sslein- Volhard, 1999). Moreover, it is known that the epiboly movements of the YSL nuclei in both Fundulus and zebrafish are not dependent on the overlying cells of the blastoderm (Trinkaus, 1984a,b, 1993; Kane et al., 1996). Thus, it seems unlikely that the convergentextension movements of YSL nuclei in zebrafish embryos are driven by the convergent-extension movements of deep cells in the overlying blastoderm. A third possibility is that, despite their similarities, the collective movements of deep cells and YSL nuclei are largely autonomous of each other. We discuss phylogenetic evidence for this hypothesis below.&quot;

	# Oriented cell division is a driving force for axis elongation. 
</p>

<p>
	&quot;Xdd1 disrupts convergence and extension of the dorsal tissue (Fig. 4b)11,13. It is thus possible that the disruption of oriented division observed in Xdd1-overexpressing embryos was due to compromised morphogenesis of the tissue. To address this, we generated mosaic clones of Xdd1-expressing cells in a wild-type background by injecting a single cleavage-stage blastomere. Such embryos undergo normal morphogenesis, and are indistinguishable from unmanipulated controls morphologically (data not shown). Subsequent analysis shows that these mosaic Xdd1-expressing cells have randomized division orientation, with angular distribution similar to that of embryos overexpressing Xdd1 ubiquitously (Fig. 3e, f; see Supplementary Information for details). Thus, Dsh has a cell-autonomous function and exerts its effect on division orientation directly.&quot; ... &quot;Our experiments on the zebrafish dorsal epiblast show both a matching of division orientation and axis elongation normally, and a disruption of oriented cell division and axis elongation after inhibition of PCP signalling. We assessed the contribution of oriented cell division to axis elongation.&quot; (Gong, Y., Mo, C. &amp; Fraser, S.E., 2004. Planar cell polarity signalling controls cell division orientation during zebrafish gastrulation. Nature, 430(7000), pp.689–693. <a name='Gong:2004bw' class='ref'></a>) -> still a double, another mechanism, like protrusion, could also be involved. leaving this cell division orientation bias as a side effect. It would be really interesting to check in my simulation if, even with random axis, cell are re-oriented by protrusive mechanism (deactivate protrusion for the dividing cell and check if there is many differences).
