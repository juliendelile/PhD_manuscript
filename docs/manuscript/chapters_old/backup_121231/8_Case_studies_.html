<h3>8.2.1. Investigating the yolk biomechanical properties  </h3>
 

	<p>
		We assume that the early development of the embryo depends on viscoelastic properties of the yolk. We aim at identifying these properties by assessing, using our simulation framework, their consequences on further morphogenesis. In particular, we expect that the yolk properties maintain the integrity of the all embryo (e.g. the yolk should resist the pressure exerted by the cells). It should however undergo successive transformations, flatten at the sphere stage, protrude at the doming stage. In addition, its active role in gastrulation is highly debated <a name='Behrndt:2012gy' class='ref'></a>. Several of these aspects we be investigated in further sections.
	</p>

	<p>
		We show here that minimal viscoelastic properties are sufficient to account for some of the embryo phenotypic features throughout cleavages and gastrulation.
	</p>


	<h4>Hypotheses</h4>



	<p>
		Our model is based on state of the art observations. The zebrafish zygote is a large cell filled with cytoplasm and lipid droplets. Starting prior the first divisions, both fluids segregate, the cytoplasm being sucked up into the dividing cells (see figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_THG_thg' class='fig'></a>). A lipid bilayer membrane progressively separates the cells at the animal pole from the lipid droplets, forming an independent structure called the <i>yolk cell</i>. After the \(9^{th}\) division cycle, the marginal deep cells divide with one daugthter cell fusing with the yolk, forming a structure called <i>yolk syncytial layer</i> (YSL). 
	</p>



	<figure id='Case_0_Yolk_THG_thg'>
		<img src="../../images/Cases_Studies/Case_0_Yolk/THG/thg.png" width="900">

Developmental timing (min) indicated top left. Scalebar (100 microns) indicated bottom left.</figcaption>
	</figure>





	<p>
		In this context, from the zygote stage, we approximate the cells and the yolk as independent structures . To capture the dynamical mechanical interaction between the cells and the yolk, we model the yolk and the cells in the same particle-based paradigm. 
	</p>


	<p>
		Furthermore, we hypothesize that it is relevant to distinguish within the yolk, the yolk syncytial layer and the inner lipid droplet structure.

		Two particle categories compose the yolk: the external yolk membrane particles form a 2-dimensional viscoelastic layer and the inner yolk particles represent the lipid droplets confined by the external layer.

		We expect the external layer to keep its surface topology whereas the internal structure can re-arrange. This is a qualitative interpretation of imaging that provide plausible properties (<a name='Case_0_Yolk_1_THG_imaging_the_zebrafish_embryo_from_the_one_cell_stage' class='fig'></a>).

	</figure>


	<h5>The yolk membrane and cortex</h5>

	<p>
		In figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_general_particles_yolk' class='fig'></a>, the yellow particles materialize the yolk membrane. By yolk membrane, we mean not only the lipid bilayer surrounding the yolk but also the cytoskeleton underlying it (acto-myosin, micro-tubules...), corresponding to the yolk cortex. The yolk membrane topology is defined by a geodesic dome. It is derived from an icosahedron, one of the five Platonic solids and it remains invariant through time. An icosahedron's surface is composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles, 12 vertices and 30 edges. This topology is refined by subdividing each triangles by four new identical equilateral triangles. The new vertices are projected on the sphere. This process is repeated 4 times to approximate a spherical shape with 5120 triangles and 2562 vertices (see figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_blender_all_gl_zoom' class='fig'></a>). 

		Any other Platonic solid could have been chosen without any significant difference. 

		However, the icosahedron has the better trade-off between stability (its elementary faces are triangles) and volume maximization (only the dodecahedron occupied a slightly larger volume by it has pentagonal faces). 

		In our geodesic dome, every vertex but the original 12 has 6 direct neighbors, the original vertices have 5 direct neighbors. These direct neighbors are labeled as rank 1 neighbors. For each yolk membrane particle \(i\), this set of neighbors is denoted by \(\mathcal{N}^{\mathrm{my},1}_i\).
	</p>




	<p>
		The forces exerted between yellow particles are pure elastic forces. Each rank 1 neighboring relationship is materialized by a linear spring. Between two yolk membrane particles \((i,j)\), the equation of the force reads: 
	</p>

	<p>
		$$ \vec{F}^{\mathrm{my}}_{ij} = k_{\mathrm{my}} (r^l_{ij} - r_{ij}) \vec{u}_{ij} $$
	</p>

	<p>
		\(k_{\mathrm{my}}\) is the stiffness constant which controls the ability to deform the neighboring link for a given applied force (higher \(k_{\mathrm{my}}\) gives stiffer resistance). \(r^l_{ij}\) is the rest length or the length of the neighboring link if no force is applied on it. Each link of the yolk membrane (i.e. links between yellow particles) has its own rest length. It is defined by the length of the link when the geodesic dome is projected on a sphere whose volume is equal to the desired yolk volume \(V_{\mathrm{yolk}}\) (radius \(R_{\mathrm{yolk}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V_{\mathrm{yolk}}}{4\pi}}\)). Concretely, 5-neighbors vertices have shorter rest lengths compared to the 6-neighbors vertices. Without this rescaling, the equilibrium shape would converge toward the original Platonic solid and not toward the sphere.
	</p>




	<p>
		As the yellow particles' neighborhood topology remains invariant, there is no plasticity in the yolk membrane alone: the original shape will be recovered after local mechanical deformation (local pushing or pulling). However, beyond certain limits, the membrane mesh may get tangled up and erratic behavior may occur. This is illustrated by an &quot;abnormal&quot; lip formed by the yolk membrane when the yolk membrane particles (yellow) are only interacting with their rank 1 neighbors (figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_erratic_topology' class='fig'></a>A). We hypothesize that increasing the yolk membrane stiffness and the spatial range of particle interactions would prevent this undesirable feature. When constraining yolk membrane particles by rank 1 and rank 2 interactions, the blastoderm-yolk margin remains smooth (figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_erratic_topology' class='fig'></a>B). Rank 2 neighbors of a yolk membrane particle are defined as rank 1 neighbors plus their rank 1 neighbors (figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_blender_all_gl_zoom' class='fig'></a>F). All the corresponding links are materialized by linear springs with the same stiffness coefficient \(k_{\mathrm{my}}\) and rest lengths \(r^l\) defined with the same procedure as rank 1 neighbors. The rank 2 neighbor set is denoted by \(\mathcal{N}^{\mathrm{my},2}_i\).

	<p>
		So far, we have idealized here is an empty balloon. The latter now has to be filled with a viscous fluid.
		In the real yolk, if the yolk membrane is damaged, inner material is expelled out of the membrane. 

		This indicates that the inside pressure is higher than the outside. 

		We hypothesized that this difference of pressure is due to the cortical tension exerted by the yolk membrane. We introduced an additional parameter: \(c_{r^l}\), a coefficient reducing the rest lengths within the yolk membrane (dimensionless). This coefficient is smaller than \(1\) so that the rest length becomes \(r^l = c_{r^l} r^{l_0}\).
	</p>

	
	<p>
		The equation of the force between two neighboring yolk membrane particles \((i,j)\) finally reads: 
	</p>

	<p>
		$$ \vec{F}^{\mathrm{my}}_{ij} = k_{\mathrm{my}} (c_{r^l} r^{l_0} - r_{ij}) \vec{u}_{ij} $$
	</p>








	<h5>The inner yolk</h5>

	<p>
		An yolk membrane as modeled above makes an empty elastic balloon. It has the ability to absorb and recover from tangential load but it hardly resists any load applied in a non-tangential manner. Inspired by the lipid droplets contours revealed by THG signals in figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_THG_thg' class='fig'></a>, we filled the yolk sac with \(N_{iy}\) identical particles of volume \(V_{\mathrm{iy}}\) and radius \(R_{\mathrm{iy}}\) (see the red particles in figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_general_particles_yolk' class='fig'></a>). Practically, \(N_{\mathrm{iy}} = 500\) particles were added in our simulation which is less than the number of lipid droplets estimated from the 3D data and represents a coarse-grained approximation.
	</p>

	
	<p>
		We considered that the membrane yolk particles' radial radius is equal to the inner yolk particles' radius. So the volume occupied by the \(N_{\mathrm{iy}}\) inner yolk particles is equal to the volume of a sphere of radius \(R_{\mathrm{yolk}} - R_{\mathrm{iy}}\).
	</p>

	<p>
		$$ N_{\mathrm{iy}} \frac{4}{3} \pi R_{\mathrm{iy}}^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (R_{\mathrm{yolk}} - R_{\mathrm{iy}})^3 $$
	</p>

	<p>
		The inner yolk particles' radius equation reads:
	</p>

	<p>
		$$ R_{\mathrm{iy}} = \frac{R_{\mathrm{yolk}}}{1 + \sqrt[3]{N_{\mathrm{iy}}}} $$ 
	</p>


	<p>
		We applied between yolk particles and membrane particles and between inner particles themselves, similar rules of interaction as described for cell-cell interactions in chapter 3. The topology of these interactions is recomputed at each time step of the simulation, first through a metric selection then through a topological selection. This adaptive topology provides yolk plasticity through passive rearrangement of the inner yolk particles.
	</p>

	
	<p>
		The interaction forces acting in between inner yolk particles or between inner yolk and yolk membrane particles are the same as the passive attraction/repulsion forces used between deep cells particles (section 3.2.3.1). 
	</p>

	<p>$$\vec{F}^P_{ij} = \vec{F}^{P,\mathrm{lin}}_{ij}.A_{ij} =
	\begin{cases}
	- w^{y}_{\mathrm{rep}}(r_{ij}-r^{\mathrm{eq}}_{ij}).A_{ij}.\vec{u}_{ij} & \text{if }r_{ij} \lt r^{\mathrm{eq}}_{ij} \\
	- w^{y}_{\mathrm{adh}}(r_{ij}-r^{\mathrm{eq}}_{ij}).A_{ij}.\vec{u}_{ij} & \text{if }r_{ij} \geq r^{\mathrm{eq}}_{ij} \;\text{and }r_{ij} \lt r^{\mathrm{max}}_{ij} \\
	\vec{0} & \text{if }r_{ij} \geq r^{\mathrm{max}}_{ij}
	\end{cases}$$</p>





	

	<h5>Parameter space for the biomechanical properties of the yolk</h5>


	<p>
		The equation of motion of the particles in this case study are summarized as following:
	</p>


	<p>
		The equation of motion for the \(N_{\mathrm{my}}\) yolk membrane particles reads:
	</p>

	<p>
		$$\vec{v}_{i} =  \frac{1}{\lambda_{0} {R_{\mathrm{my}}}^2} \left( \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}^{\mathrm{my},2}_i} \left( k_{\mathrm{my}} (c_{r^l} r^{l_0}_{ij} - r_{ij}) . \vec{u}_{ij} \right) + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}^t_i} \left( \vec{F}^P_{ij} \right) \right)$$
	</p>

	<p>
		The equation of motion for the \(N_{\mathrm{iy}}\) inner yolk particles reads:
	</p>

	<p>
		$$\vec{v}_{i} =  \frac{1}{\lambda_{0} {R_{\mathrm{iy}}}^2} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}^t_i} \left( \vec{F}^P_{ij} \right)$$
	</p>


	<p>
		The system is underdetermined, there are \(N_{\mathrm{my}} + N_{\mathrm{iy}}\) equations and as many spatial variables. In addition, we have the following variables: \(\lambda_0\), \(w^{y}_{\mathrm{adh}}\), \(w^{y}_{\mathrm{rep}}\), \(k_{\mathrm{my}}\), \(c_{r^l}\), the simulation time step \(\Delta t_s\) and a number of other variables that were <i>a priori</i> (e.g. \(R_{\mathrm{my}}\), \(R_{\mathrm{iy}}\)) fixed or calibrated when designing the simulation (e.g. \(a\) and \(c^{\mathrm{max}}\) which determine the surface of contact between particles).
	</p>

	<p>
		Finally, the simulation provides access to the following ratios:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>\( \overline{w}^{y}_{\mathrm{adh}} = \frac{w^{y}_{\mathrm{adh}}}{\lambda_0} \)</li>
		<li>\( \overline{w}^{y}_{\mathrm{rep}} = \frac{w^{y}_{\mathrm{rep}}}{\lambda_0} \)</li>
		<li>\( \overline{k}_{\mathrm{my}} = \frac{k_{\mathrm{my}}}{\lambda_0} \)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		and the last two free parameters are the yolk membrane surface scaling parameter \(c_{r^l}\) and simulation time step \(\Delta t_s\).
	</p>






	<h4>An experimental scenario to explore the parameter space</h4>
	


	<p>
		We expect the yolk to have specific behaviors in terms of deformation under external stress and subsequent resilience. In order to assess these features, we designed an experimental protocol, applied to both live specimens and simulated ones. 


		Confronting measurements in both cases is our strategy to explore the parameters space to:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>qualitatively discuss the fitness landscape,</li>
		<li>define optimal parameters.</li>
	</ul>



	<h5>Experimental protocol: live specimen</h5>

	measure, start from simulated reconstructed data



		These are the qualitative observations the quantitative measurements that can be derived from the in vivo imaging.




	<p>
		A spherical 1-cell stage embryo lies on its side in an agarose mold and a glass bead is pressed on the lateral side of the embryo for a period of time \(\Delta t\), starting at \(t_0\). The force is applied along an axis parallel to the agarose surface and, on the opposite side, the embryo is blocked by an agarose wall. Pressure is applied to the bead until it enters into the yolk by approximatively 40 percent of the yolk diameter. At \(t_1 = t_0 + \Delta t\), the bead is removed and the yolk progressively recovers its initial shape. The operation is recorded with a 3CCD camera (Hitachi HV-D20) on a Leica MZ16F stereo microscope (movie <a name='121120_121120_raw_lateral_embryo1' class='fig'></a>).

		<figcaption><strong>Experimental deformation of the egg yolk.</strong></figcaption>
	</figure>


	<p>
		Qualitatively, the yolk is deformable with the yolk membrane surrounding the bead in a crater like structure somewhat larger than the bead diameter. After removing the bead, the yolk quickly recovers its shape. The following measurements allow us to quantify the process.
	</p>



	<p>
		We measured every 0.8 second the normalized length of the yolk along the compression axis: ratio of the deformed embryo's diameter \(L\) over the relaxed embryo's diameter \(L_r\) before compression.
	</p>

	</figure>



	<h5>Experimental protocol: simulation</h5>

 	<p>
 		The simulated experimental protocol mimics the live one described above. The algorithmic implementation of the model integrates an artificial spherical bead which is forced to move toward the center of the yolk. Particles, whose original position lies inside the bead, are displaced by being projected on its surface. Similarly to the experimental live protocol, we do specify the force necessary to induce the particle's motion but we impose their displacement. The ball is removed when it has been sunk to a depth equal to 40 percent of the initial yolk diameter.</a>

	The same measure is performed on experimental (resp. simulated) embryo generically denominated \(e\) (resp. \(s\)).

	<h5>Fitness function</h5>


	plot simu + experimental

	<p>
		We define a fitness function which allows us to confront measurements.
	</p>


	<p>
	 	The fitness function \(F_{\mathrm{yolk relaxation}}\) sums the absolute difference between live and simulated normalized length evolution. We define \(L^s(i)\) (resp. \(L^l(i)\) the deformed yolk diameter of a simulated (resp. live) specimen measured at the timestep \(i\). \(L^s_r\) (resp. \(L^l_r\)) is the initial uncompressed yolk diameter. Hence, for \(n\) time steps, the equation of the fitness function reads:
	</p>

	<p>
		$$ F_{\mathrm{yolk relaxation}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left | \frac{L^s(i)}{L^l_r} - \frac{L^l(i)}{L^l_r} \right | $$
	</p>

	


	<h5>Fitness landscape</h5>

	<p>
		The explored parameter space is 4-dimensional. We performed a regular sampling with the following ranges and cardinalities:
	</p>

	<figure id='parameter_space_table_parameter_space_table'>
		<img src="../../images/Cases_Studies/Case_0_Yolk/parameter_space_table/parameter_space_table.png" width="700">
		<figcaption><strong>Ranges, cardinalities and units of the four parameters explored in this study.</strong></figcaption>
	</figure>

	<p>
		For each realization, which means a simulation with a set of parameters, according to the protocol above, and leading to a phenotype, the fitness is evaluated according to the aforementioned function. The simulation time step has been calibrated to match the slope of the relaxation curve obtained in the live experiment (Fig. <a name='Case_0_Yolk_all_curves_plot_fitness_ok' class='fig'></a>). The calibrated value of a simulated time step is \(6.66667\) milliseconds (i.e. 120 simulated timestep is equivalent to 0.8 seconds)
	</p>

In abscissa, the normalized length of the yolk diameter is plotted. In ordinate, the time from the moment the bead is pulled away from the yolk surface. </figcaption>
	</figure>


	<p>
		This plot indicates that the simulated phenotype leads to a relaxation profile similar to the profile provided by the live experiment. However, another representation is needed to visualize the fitness pattern in the 4-dimensional parameter space. We developed an interface allowing us to visualize a 3-dimensional cube of fitness and select the forth dimension manually (Fig. <a name='4D_fusion_vertical' class='fig'></a>).

		<figcaption><strong>An example of 3D plot of the fitness landscape in the parameter space.</strong> This figure aims at presenting the coordinate system used in Fig. <a name='4D_fusion_vertical' class='fig'></a>. Here, the repulsion coefficient \( \overline{w}^{y}_{\mathrm{rep}}\) of the force exerted between inner yolk particles has a fixed value (i.e. \(3.7\) \(10^{-6}\)). The vertical axis gives the coefficient \(c_{r^l}\) which determines the equilibrium surface of the yolk membrane. The depth axis gives the adhesion coefficient \( \overline{w}^{y}_{\mathrm{adh}}\) which modulates the cohesion of the inner yolk particles. The width axis gives the yolk membrane stiffness coefficient \( \overline{k}_{\mathrm{my}} \). It should be noted that the values actually plotted on the depth (resp. width) axis correspond to the value of \( w^{y}_{\mathrm{adh}}\) (resp. \( k_{\mathrm{my}} \)) and should be divided by \(\lambda_0\) (i.e. \(3.7\) \(10^{-6}\)) to match the over-lined variable values presented in Fig. <a name='parameter_space_table_parameter_space_table' class='fig'></a>.

All the coordinates are described in Fig. <a name='4D_single_3D_plot' class='fig'></a>. Each row corresponds to a different value of the coefficient of repulsion between inner yolk particles \( \overline{w}^{y}_{\mathrm{rep}} \). The value of \( \overline{w}^{y}_{\mathrm{rep}} \) varies regularly between \(3.7\) \(10^{-6}\) for the top row to \(5.55\) \(10^{-5}\) for the bottom row.</figcaption>
	</figure>


	<h5>Fitness pattern analysis</h5>
	
	
	<p>
		We observe patterns of low (=optimal) fitness in the left column. The shape of isofitness patterns indicates that the adhesion coefficient between inner particles does not impact the relaxation behavior of the yolk (no effect of changes along the depth axis). We can thus interpret that the yolk membrane properties (stiffness and surface equilibrium) account for the good behavior of the system. 
	</p>


	<p>
		However, low values of inner yolk particle repulsion induce a shrinking of the yolk volume as it can be seen in row 1 to 5. Conversely, as the inner yolk repulsion increases, the yolk volume increases. From a biological point of view, this feature does not make sense as we would rather expect the yolk to be incompressible and indicates one of the limits of the model that have been chosen. We thus decided to limit the exploration of the parameter space to values that keep the yolk volume within a 20% variation of the targeted volume (right column). 
	</p>


	<p>
		In addition, when the inner yolk repulsion increases and the membrane stiffness is too high with a small yolk equilibrium surface, the numerical simulation of the model is diverging and the phenotype can no longer be computed (more and more missing points from the top to the bottom rows in the left and central column). The useful space displayed in the right column indicate a single layer of low fitness value and the spatial orientation of this layer shows the benefit of increasing membrane surface equilibrium and membrane stiffness. 
	</p>


	<p>
		The model thus indicates that the yolk membrane is responsible for the yolk relaxation behavior, the inner yolk particle being only used to fill the space and maintain the yolk volume. As already mentioned, yolk membrane actually means here membrane+cortex, and from a biological point of view, the low fitness domain should provide indications of appropriate fitness and surface equilibrium values for the yolk membrane+cortex.  
	</p>





	

	 <h4>Discussion</h4>

	<p>
		This very simple case study shows the potential and the limitations of the model and also brings a number of generic questions.
	</p>


	<p>
		The choice of a multi agent framework led to the representation of the yolk and yolk membrane as collections of interacting particles. If the model seems indeed suitable to mimic some of the observed properties of the biological system, the consequence of inner yolk particles repulsion and attraction on the yolk volume is unlikely to be biologically relevant. We rather assume the inner yolk to be and incompressible liquid, although this hypothesis has not been validated experimentally. In any case, large variations as obtained through the simulation certainly have to be discarded. We assume that this drawback does not prevent to explore the membrane properties to try and interpret biologically the resulting fitness landscape. 
	</p>


	<p>
		The numerical implementation of the model brought a number of difficulties including instabilities of the numerical integration that prevented to complete the calculation of certain phenotypes. It however might be interpreted that most of the parameter space point that were not explored were actually unlikely to fit within the best fitness pattern. In addition, the computation time step that had to be set to fit the experimental scenario of the yolk relaxation is far too small to be used for the simulation of the embryo development until the end of gastrulation (i.e. 10 hpf). Such a time step is far to demanding in terms of computational power. 
	</p>


	<p>
		Interpreting the calculated fitness landscape first brought the problem of the representation and visualization of high dimensional data. Furthermore, we did not here fully explore the parameter space. Some of the observed behaviors suggest that several fitness layers arise from exploring values of the inner yolk particles repulsion coefficient. From row 4 in the left column of Fig. 8.15, the coexistence of two low fitness layers suggests that a periodic behavior might happen. Further exploring values along the vertical axis should be done. Hence, we so far have no explanation of this behavior of the model. 
	</p>


	<p>
		The biological interpretation of the model is a major issue. We expect at some point to be able to derive real physical values from the simulation parameters. The simulation values are scaled by lambda and additional stress-strain measurements would be needed to set this parameter other than arbitrarily. 
	</p>


	<p>
		The very simple experimental scenario explored here should lead to a more extensive study to i) provide measurements for a cohort of individual, ii) compare the yolk behavior in different locations, and at different developmental times, iii) control the applied force and possibly replace the pushing strategy by pulling with a know aspiration force. In addition, the measurement of the deformation might be more precise and accurate than performed here. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Finally, in addition to define an optimal fitness the model should allow defining a viability pattern. The fitness landscape and the viability pattern might then be adjusted by exploring other yolk desirable properties in terms of compatibility with later morphogenetic events such as doming or the constriction accompagnying gastrulation movements.

	<p>
		Study spans between the 8cell and the 512cell stage (and later if data is available).
	</p>


	<p>
		Cell cycle and division axis are imposed. 
	</p>


	<p>
		We want to decipher the pattern of evolution of the embryo shape (the evolution toward the high stage: diminishing deep cell/yolk interface surface and increasing height of the embryo). The key parameters of this study are the Cell/Cell and Cell/Yolk attraction/repulsion parameters (4params). Yolk mechanical params could also be discussed.

		Measure 1: From the simulated and experimental 3D alpha shape, we count the number of cells from the simulated data set which are outside the alphashape of the experimental data set and vice versa. In the ideal case, the sum of these &quot;outside&quot; centers is nul. This sum will be the fitness function for this measure.

	</p>

	<p>
		When the division cycle reaches its N_evl_formation th occurence (N_evl_formation  = ), the external cells perform a radial division (normal to the embryo surface) and the external (internal) daughter cell become part of the EVL (IC) population. The externality property is determined by an topological method called &quot;alpha-shaping&quot;. The initial EVL lateral radius R_lat is equal to the initial zygote radius divided by the 2^(numgeneration / 3) so the same radius has its sister IC. The apico-basal radius Rap is computed to conserve the yolk volume .5*(4/3)*PI*Ric0^3 * (1/2)^(numgeneration) divided by the surface of the cell (PI * Rlat^2)
	</p>


	<p>
		Mechanical equilibrium: transfer IC->EVL, EVL->IC
	</p>

	<p>
		For a given period of time after the EVL formation, the cell may be transfer between the two population in both direction (IC->EVL, EVL->IC). The criteria for the transfer is based on geometrical consideration (alpha shaping).

		The dimension of the EVL->IC conversion gives a regular radius of its generation, the inverse conversion gives a regular Rlat for its generation and the Rab accordingly (see initrialization)

		Let \(T_s\) be the starting time step of the measure. At \(T_s\), each cell receives a label (total \(N_{label}\)). As time advances and cells divide, daughter cells will inherit the label of their mother.

	<p>
		We measure at each time step which label has a neighboring contact with another label. This measure is represented by a square matrix \(C(t)\) of size \(N_{label} \times N_{label} \). An element \(c_{i,j}(t)\) of the matrix has a value of 1 if at least a cell having a label i is in contact with at least a cell having a label j at the current time step. Otherwise, \(c_{i,j}(t)\) is 0.

<p>
	<strong>Questions</strong>
</p>


<p>
	Background (bio):
</p>


<p>
	The formation of the antero-posterior axis of the embryo is associated with an elongation of the tissue.
</p>


<p>
	Various cellular mechanisms may be responsible for an elongation (growth along a preferential axis):
</p>

<ul>
	<li>cell deformation along the APaxis: C. elegans, Phallusia (ascidians ?)</li>
	<li>active cell rearrangement: chord Pallusia, Drosophila</li>
	<li>oriented cell division, amplified with cell growth: XXXX ??</li>
</ul>

<p>
	During the zebrafish gastrulation, this episode is called Convergence-Extension (CE) (see Review chapitre 6 XXX).
</p>





<h4>Q1. Influence of the division orientation axis on the convergence</h4>







<p>
	-> Is it possible to have a convergence-extension behavior if the division orientation axes are random ? we can test it
</p>


<p>
	-> Does it help to have oriented division axes along the XXXXX ? we can test it
</p>



<p>
	We postulate that cell are re-oriented after division because of the external protrusive activity around them. On peut le montrer en mettant des divisions d'axes random et en plotant la reorientation dû aux actions mechaniques locales (protrusions des voisines.)
</p>




<p>
	Biblio:
</p>


<p>
	<i>In vivo</i> confocal imaging shows that mitotic divisions in the dorsal region of the zebrafish gastrulation are preferentially oriented along the animal vegetal axis and this orientation is a driving force of axis elongation <a name='Gong:2004bw' class='ref'></a> 
</p>


	<p>
		&quot;Xdd1 disrupts convergence and extension of the dorsal tissue (Fig. 4b)11,13. It is thus possible that the disruption of oriented division observed in Xdd1-overexpressing embryos was due to compromised morphogenesis of the tissue. To address this, we generated mosaic clones of Xdd1-expressing cells in a wild-type background by injecting a single cleavage-stage blastomere. Such embryos undergo normal morphogenesis, and are indistinguishable from unmanipulated controls morphologically (data not shown). Subsequent analysis shows that these mosaic Xdd1-expressing cells have randomized division orientation, with angular distribution similar to that of embryos overexpressing Xdd1 ubiquitously (Fig. 3e, f; see Supplementary Information for details). Thus, Dsh has a cell-autonomous function and exerts its effect on division orientation directly.&quot; ... &quot;Our experiments on the zebrafish dorsal epiblast show both a matching of division orientation and axis elongation normally, and a disruption of oriented cell division and axis elongation after inhibition of PCP signalling. We assessed the contribution of oriented cell division to axis elongation.&quot; (Gong, Y., Mo, C. &amp; Fraser, S.E., 2004. Planar cell polarity signalling controls cell division orientation during zebrafish gastrulation. Nature, 430(7000), pp.689–693. <a name='Gong:2004bw' class='ref'></a>) -> still a double, another mechanism, like protrusion, could also be involved. leaving this cell division orientation bias as a side effect. It would be really interesting to check in my simulation if, even with random axis, cell are re-oriented by protrusive mechanism (deactivate protrusion for the dividing cell and check if there is many differences).

	We postulate that the epiblast CE is unaffected by the lack of hypoblast mechanically. Its different phenotype is due to a change in the polarization field in the tissue whose difference correlates with lack of polarization source in the region of the prechorlale plate.
