<h3>8.2.1. Investigating the yolk biomechanical properties  </h3>
 

	<p>
		We assume that the early development of the embryo depends on viscoelastic properties of the yolk. We aim at identifying these properties by assessing, using our simulation framework, their consequences on further morphogenesis. In particular, we expect that the yolk properties maintain the integrity of the all embryo (e.g. the yolk should resist the pressure exerted by the cells). It should however undergo successive transformations, flatten at the sphere stage, protrude at the doming stage. In addition, its active role in gastrulation is highly debated <a name='Behrndt:2012gy' class='ref'></a>. Several of these aspects we be investigated in further sections.
	</p>

	<p>
		We show here that minimal viscoelastic properties are sufficient to account for some of the embryo phenotypic features throughout cleavages and gastrulation.
	</p>


	<h4>Hypotheses</h4>



	<p>
		Our model is based on state of the art observations. The zebrafish zygote is a large cell filled with cytoplasm and lipid droplets. Starting prior the first divisions, both fluids segregate, the cytoplasm being sucked up into the dividing cells (see figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_THG_thg' class='fig'></a>). A lipid bilayer membrane progressively separates the cells at the animal pole from the lipid droplets, forming an independent structure called the <i>yolk cell</i>. After the \(9^{th}\) division cycle, the marginal deep cells divide with one daugthter cell fusing with the yolk, forming a structure called <i>yolk syncytial layer</i> (YSL). 
	</p>



	<figure id='Case_0_Yolk_THG_thg'>
		<img src="../../images/Cases_Studies/Case_0_Yolk/THG/thg.png" width="900">

Developmental timing (min) indicated top left. Scalebar (100 microns) indicated bottom left.</figcaption>
	</figure>





	<p>
		In this context, from the zygote stage, we approximate the cells and the yolk as independent structures . To capture the dynamical mechanical interaction between the cells and the yolk, we model the yolk and the cells in the same particle-based paradigm. 
	</p>


	<p>
		Furthermore, we hypothesize that it is relevant to distinguish within the yolk, the yolk syncytial layer and the inner lipid droplet structure.

		Two particle categories compose the yolk: the external yolk membrane particles form a 2-dimensional viscoelastic layer and the inner yolk particles represent the lipid droplets confined by the external layer.

		We expect the external layer to keep its surface topology whereas the internal structure can re-arrange. This is a qualitative interpretation of imaging that provide plausible properties (<a name='Case_0_Yolk_1_THG_imaging_the_zebrafish_embryo_from_the_one_cell_stage' class='fig'></a>).

	</figure>


	<h5>The yolk membrane and cortex</h5>

	<p>
		In figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_general_particles_yolk' class='fig'></a>, the yellow particles materialize the yolk membrane. By yolk membrane, we mean not only the lipid bilayer surrounding the yolk but also the cytoskeleton underlying it (acto-myosin, micro-tubules...), corresponding to the yolk cortex. The yolk membrane topology is defined by a geodesic dome. It is derived from an icosahedron, one of the five Platonic solids and it remains invariant through time. An icosahedron's surface is composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles, 12 vertices and 30 edges. This topology is refined by subdividing each triangles by four new identical equilateral triangles. The new vertices are projected on the sphere. This process is repeated 4 times to approximate a spherical shape with 5120 triangles and 2562 vertices (see figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_blender_all_gl_zoom' class='fig'></a>). 

		Any other Platonic solid could have been chosen without any significant difference. 

		However, the icosahedron has the better trade-off between stability (its elementary faces are triangles) and volume maximization (only the dodecahedron occupied a slightly larger volume by it has pentagonal faces). 

		In our geodesic dome, every vertex but the original 12 has 6 direct neighbors, the original vertices have 5 direct neighbors. These direct neighbors are labeled as rank 1 neighbors. For each yolk membrane particle \(i\), this set of neighbors is denoted by \(\mathcal{N}^{\mathrm{my},1}_i\).
	</p>




	<p>
		The forces exerted between yellow particles are pure elastic forces. Each rank 1 neighboring relationship is materialized by a linear spring. Between two yolk membrane particles \((i,j)\), the equation this force 
	</p>

	\vec{F}^{P,\mathrm{lin}}_{ij}

	<p>
		$$ \vec{F}^{\mathrm{my}}_{ij} = k_{\mathrm{my}} (r_l - r) $$
	</p>

	<p>
		\(k_{\mathrm{my}}\) is the stiffness constant which controls the ability to deform the neighboring link for a given applied force (higher \(k_{\mathrm{my}}\) gives stiffer resistance). \(r^l_{ij}\) is the rest length or the length of the neighboring link if no force is applied on it. Each link of the yolk membrane (i.e. links between yellow particles) has its own rest length. It is defined by the length of the link when the geodesic dome is projected on a sphere whose volume is equal to the desired yolk volume \(V_{yolk}\) (radius \(R_{yolk} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V_{yolk}}{4\pi}}\)). Concretely, 5-neighbors vertices have shorter rest lengths compared to the 6-neighbors vertices. Without this rescaling, the equilibrium shape would converge toward the original Platonic solid and not toward the sphere.
	</p>




	<p>
		As the yellow particles' neighborhood topology remains invariant, there is no plasticity in the yolk membrane alone: the original shape will be recovered after local mechanical deformation (local pushing or pulling). However, beyond certain limits, the membrane mesh may get tangled up and erratic behavior may occur. This is illustrated by an &quot;abnormal&quot; lip formed by the yolk membrane when the yolk membrane particles (yellow) are only interacting with their rank 1 neighbors (figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_erratic_topology' class='fig'></a>A). We hypothesize that increasing the yolk membrane stiffness and the spatial range of particle interactions would prevent this undesirable feature. When constraining yolk membrane particles by rank 1 and rank 2 interactions, the blastoderm-yolk margin remains smooth (figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_erratic_topology' class='fig'></a>B). Rank 2 neighbors of a yolk membrane particle are defined as rank 1 neighbors plus their rank 1 neighbors (figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_blender_all_gl_zoom' class='fig'></a>F). All the corresponding links are materialized by linear springs with the same stiffness coefficient \(k_{my}\) and rest lengths \(r_l\) defined with the same procedure as rank 1 neighbors.

	</figure>

	<h5>The inner yolk</h5>

	<p>
		An yolk membrane as modeled above makes an empty elastic balloon. It has the ability to absorb and recover from tangential load but it hardly resists any load applied in a non-tangential manner. Inspired by the lipid droplets contours revealed by THG signals in figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_THG_thg' class='fig'></a>, we filled the yolk sac with \(N_{iy}\) identical particles of volume \(V_{iy}\) and radius \(R_{iy}\) (see the red particles in figure <a name='Case_0_Yolk_general_particles_yolk' class='fig'></a>). Practically, \(N_{iy} = 500\) particles were added in our simulation which is less than the number of lipid droplets estimated from the 3D data and represents a coarse-grained approximation.
	</p>

	
	<p>
		We considered that the membrane yolk particles' radial radius is equal to the inner yolk particles' radius. So the volume occupied by the \(N_{iy}\) inner yolk particles is equal to the volume of a sphere of radius \(R_{yolk} - R_{iy}\).
	</p>

	<p>
		$$ N_{iy} \frac{4}{3} \pi R_{iy}^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (R_{yolk} - R_{iy})^3 $$
	</p>

	<p>
		The inner yolk particles' radius equation reads:
	</p>

	<p>
		$$ R_{iy} = \frac{R_{yolk}}{1 + \sqrt[3]{N_{iy}}} $$ 
	</p>


	<p>
		We applied between yolk particles and membrane particles and between inner particles themselves, similar rules of interaction as described for cell-cell interactions in chapter 3. The topology of these interactions is recomputed at each time step of the simulation, first through a metric selection then through a topological selection. This adaptive topology provides yolk plasticity through passive rearrangement of the inner yolk particles.
	</p>

	
	<p>
		The interaction forces acting in between inner yolk particles or between inner yolk and yolk membrane particles are the same as the passive attraction/repulsion forces used between deep cells particles (section 3.2.3.1). 
	</p>

	<p>$$\vec{F}^P_{ij} = A_{ij}.\vec{F}^{P,\mathrm{lin}}_{ij} =
	\begin{cases}
	- w_{\mathrm{rep}}A_{ij}(r_{ij}-r^{\mathrm{eq}}_{ij}) & \text{if }r_{ij} \lt r^{\mathrm{eq}}_{ij} \\
	- w_{\mathrm{adh}}A_{ij}(r_{ij}-r^{\mathrm{eq}}_{ij}) & \text{if }r_{ij} \geq r^{\mathrm{eq}}_{ij} \;\text{and }r_{ij} \lt r^{\mathrm{max}}_{ij} \\
	0 & \text{if }r_{ij} \geq r^{\mathrm{max}}_{ij}
	\end{cases}$$</p>


	<h5>Four parameters drive the biomechanical properties of the yolk</h5>

	<p>
		The first three parameters have been defined above:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>\(w_{adh}\), the attraction coefficient of the interaction forces between inner particles, and inner particle and yolk membrane (\(N.m^{-3}\)).</li>
		<li>\(w_{rep}\), the repulsion coefficient of the interaction forces between inner particles, and inner particle and yolk membrane (\(N.m^{-3}\)).</li>
		<li>\(k_{my}\), the stiffness of the yolk membrane interaction forces (\(N.m^{-1}\)).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		However, what we have idealized here is an empty balloon filled with a viscous fluid whose volume is exactly the volume of the empty balloon. In the real yolk, if the yolk membrane is damaged, inner material is expelled out of the membrane. This indicates that the inside pressure is higher than the outside. We hypothesized that this difference of pressure is due to the cortical tension exerted by the yolk membrane. In this context, our fourth parameter is:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>\(c_{r_l}\), a coefficient reducing the rest lengths within the yolk membrane (dimensionless). This coefficient is smaller than \(1\) so that the rest length became \(r_l = c_{r_l} r_{l_0}\).</li>
	</ul>



	<h4>An experimental scenario to explore the parameter space</h4>
	


	<p>
		We expect the yolk to have specific behaviors in terms of deformation under external stress and subsequent resilience. In order to assess these features, we designed an experimental protocol, applied to both live specimens and simulated ones. 


		Confronting measurements in both cases is our strategy to explore the parameters space to:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>qualitatively discuss the fitness landscape,</li>
		<li>define optimal parameters.</li>
	</ul>



	<h5>Experimental protocol: live specimen</h5>

	measure, start from simulated reconstructed data

	1. We let the yolk get its initial shape (as the model does not assure that the yolk volume is conserved)
	2. We move the ball toward the yolk along a straight axis passing through the center of the yolk. We use antero-posterior axis as a mark.
	3. The ball is removed when it has been sunk to a depth equal to 63% of the initial yolk diameter along the AP axis.
	4. The relaxing yolk diameter is measured at regular time step.


	
	the normalized length of the yolk along the compression axis as the ratio of the deformed embryo's diameter \(L\) over the relaxed embryo's diameter \(L_r\) before compression.

	The same measure is performed on experimental (resp. simulated) embryo generically denominated \(e\) (resp. \(s\)).





		These are the qualitative observations the quantitative measurements that can be derived from the in vivo imaging.




	<p>
		An spherical 1-cell stage embryo lies on its side in an agarose mold and a glass bead is pressed on the lateral side of the embryo for a period of time \(\Delta t\), starting at \(t_0\). The force is applied along an axis parallel to the agarose surface and, on the opposite side, the embryo is blocked by an agarose wall. Pressure is applied to the bead until it enters into the yolk by approximatively 40 percent of the yolk diameter. At \(t_1 = t_0 + \Delta t\), the bead is removed and the yolk progressively recovers its initial shape. The operation is recorded with a 3CCD camera (Hitachi HV-D20) on a Leica MZ16F stereo microscope (movie <a name='121120_121120_raw_lateral_embryo1' class='fig'></a>).

	<p>
		Qualitatively, the yolk is deformable with the yolk membrane surrounding the bead in a crater like structure somewhat larger than the bead diameter. After removing the bead, the yolk quickly recovers its shape. The following measurements allow us to quantify the process.

<h3>8.2.2. Cell Cycle  </h3>
 


	
		Regarder papier Ben Simons sur cycle cellulaire cellule souche pour la mise en valeur d'un modèle à priori simple de rythmes cellulaire -> He, J. et al., 2012. How Variable Clones Build an Invariant Retina. Neuron, 75(5), pp.786–798. <a name='He:2012dg' class='ref'></a>
	


 
	<p>
		Objective: setting up the cell cycle 
	</p>



	
	<h4>Hypotheses</h4>
	

	<p>
		In this study, except for the Enveloping Layer cell population (see section 8.4  XXXXXXX), the cell cycle is uncoupled from the other cellular mechanisms. It is so because we do not have specific hypothesis to test on this topic.
	</p>


	<p>
		However, cells do divide and their size and number has is a factor of the zebrafish early development. 

		During the midblastula transition which starts at cycle 10 (512 to 1024 cells, 3hpf) and ends at the cycle 13, the cell cycle length increases as the zygotic transcription begins (<a name='Kane:1993wp' class='ref'></a>). It has been postulated that the lengthening of the cell cycle correlates with the ratio of the nucleus size over the cell size, and, from the cycle 14, that the correlation stops (<a name='Kane:1996uk' class='ref'></a>).


		If this factor is fundamental for the early stages as a minimal number of cells is required to perform the different episodes of the zebrafish development, it appears that these episodes are robust to some perturbation of the cell cycle. In <a name='Zhang:2008gw' class='ref'></a>, a zebrafish mutant inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (<i>emi1</i> for <i>Early mitotic inhibitor-1</i>) is introduced. It ceases all mitosis at the shield stage and still the embryo gastrulates and elongates.
	</p>


	<p>
		In order to avoid perturbing the other mechanisms, we explore the possible cell cycling rules and fit them to experimental measures.
	</p>

	<h4>Questions</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Q1. : the cell cycle is approximated as constant during the first ten division, what is this constant ?</li>
		<li>Q2. : decide whether, after the tenth cell cycle, the progression of the cell cycle is geometric or arithmetic.</li>
		<li>Q3. : as the cell cycle desynchronizes and we do not propose hypotheses to explain it, how to characterize this variability.</li>

		According to Kane and Kimmel <a name='Kane:1993wp' class='ref'></a>, cell cycle increases as \(\frac{1}{V_{cell}}\). If cell is divided in two identical daughter cells, it means the cell volume is divided by 2 and the cell cycle double after eath mitosis. Geometric growth of the cell cycle.

		In the following, the length of the cell cycle is denoted by \(\textrm{CC}\). It is function of an integer value which is its iteration. \(\textrm{CC}(12)\) is the length of the 12\(^{\textrm{th}}\) cell cycle. The iteration from which the cell cycle augments is denoted by \(\lambda_{\textrm{cc,s}}\) and the last iteration by \(\lambda_{\textrm{cc,e}}\).
	</p>


	<h5>Geometric progression of the cell cycle</h5>

	<p>
		The geometric progression of the cell cycle iteratively multiplies the length of the cell cycle by a constant value, the <i>common ratio</i>, denoted by \(r\).

	<p>
		$$ \forall n \in \left[ \lambda_{\textrm{cc,s}}, \lambda_{\textrm{cc,e}} \right], \textrm{CC}(n+1) = r \cdot \textrm{CC}(n)$$

	<p>
		We suppose that the common ratio follows a uniform distribution centered on \(r_0\) and with a range of \(w_r\).

<h3>8.2.3. Cleavage  </h3>
 



 
 
 
 
	<p>
		<strong>A. Hypotheses</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
		Study spans between the 8cell and the 512cell stage (and later if data is available).
	</p>


	<p>
		Cell cycle and division axis are imposed. 
	</p>


	<p>
		We want to decipher the pattern of evolution of the embryo shape (the evolution toward the high stage: diminishing deep cell/yolk interface surface and increasing height of the embryo). The key parameters of this study are the Cell/Cell and Cell/Yolk attraction/repulsion parameters (4params). Yolk mechanical params could also be discussed.
	</p>



	<p>

	</p>




	<p>
		Cell centers from 081014h used in the science papers. (080917h and 081024h also available). The average dataset looks flat.

	<p>
		<strong>C. Reconstruction</strong>
	</p>





	<p>
		Both simulated and experiment cell centers are superposed. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Measure 1: at each time step, we compute the 3D alpha-shape from the cell center set.
	</p>


	<p>
		On the figure below, Mesure 2: another possibility of recontruction. The centers could be projected on a half plane delimited by the Animal Vegetal axis. The 2D alpha-shape of these projected centers reveals more tractable parameters. For example, separating the external curve (above) and the internal curve (at the cells/yolk border) and interpolating.

	<p>
		<strong>D. Fitness function</strong>
	</p>


	<p>
		Measure 1: From the simulated and experimental 3D alpha shape, we count the number of cells from the simulated data set which are outside the alphashape of the experimental data set and vice versa. In the ideal case, the sum of these &quot;outside&quot; centers is nul. This sum will be the fitness function for this measure.

	</p>


	<p>
		Formation at cycle N:
	</p>

	<p>
		When the division cycle reaches its N_evl_formation th occurence (N_evl_formation  = ), the external cells perform a radial division (normal to the embryo surface) and the external (internal) daughter cell become part of the EVL (IC) population. The externality property is determined by an topological method called &quot;alpha-shaping&quot;. The initial EVL lateral radius R_lat is equal to the initial zygote radius divided by the 2^(numgeneration / 3) so the same radius has its sister IC. The apico-basal radius Rap is computed to conserve the yolk volume .5*(4/3)*PI*Ric0^3 * (1/2)^(numgeneration) divided by the surface of the cell (PI * Rlat^2)
	</p>


	<p>
		Mechanical equilibrium: transfer IC->EVL, EVL->IC
	</p>

	<p>
		For a given period of time after the EVL formation, the cell may be transfer between the two population in both direction (IC->EVL, EVL->IC). The criteria for the transfer is based on geometrical consideration (alpha shaping).

		The dimension of the EVL->IC conversion gives a regular radius of its generation, the inverse conversion gives a regular Rlat for its generation and the Rab accordingly (see initrialization)

	<p>
		The cell pressure/tension is approximated by the average of the force intensity applied on it.
	</p>

	<p>
		Attention, discussion: pas de division par la surface... et la moyenne annule complétement les assymetries dans l'orientatino des forces. example pression > 0 selon un axe, tension > 0 selon l'axe orthogonale -> moyenne nulle...

	</p>


	<p>
		if the pressure is above a given threshold (mecha_params.EVLgrowthTheshold), the lateral radius R_lateral is inrcreased by a given amount (Rlat * params_const.EVL_growth_ratio_lateral = 1.01 * Rlat) and, to conserve the volume, the apico-basal radius R_ap is decreased (Rap = Rap / (params_const.EVL_growth_ratio_lateral*params_const.EVL_growth_ratio_lateral))
	</p>



	<p>
		cell cycle:
	</p>

	<p>
		if the cell lateral radius is above a given threshold (mecha.params.EVLSiveLimit * params_const.EVLPartRadiusLat0) (and if the EVL cell is not in the mphase), a division is triggered. 
	</p>



	<p>
		Cell division:
	</p>

	<p>
		The daughter cells have identical size, they maintain their apicobasal radius and the lateral radius is reduced by factor (1/2)^(1/2) to have Vdaugthr = (1 / 2) Vmother
	</p>

	<p>
		The axis of division is selected random in the tangential plane.

	<p>
		We have implemented standard epithelium measure (see Escudero, L.M. et al., 2011. Epithelial organisation revealed by a network of cellular contacts. Nature communications, 2, p.526. link <a name='Escudero:2011cv' class='ref'></a>) ie:

	<p>

		<strong>C. Reconstruction</strong>
	</p>


	<p>
		Let \(T_s\) be the starting time step of the measure. At \(T_s\), each cell receives a label (total \(N_{label}\)). As time advances and cells divide, daughter cells will inherit the label of their mother. 
	</p>


	<p>
		We measure at each time step which label has a neighboring contact with another label. This measure is represented by a square matrix \(C(t)\) of size \(N_{label} \times N_{label} \). An element \(c_{i,j}(t)\) of the matrix has a value of 1 if at least a cell having a label i is in contact with at least a cell having a label j at the current time step. Otherwise, \(c_{i,j}(t)\) is 0.
	</p>


	<p>
		A time integration of the matrix indicates which cell lineage is

<h3>8.2.9. Convergence-Extension  </h3>









<p>
	<strong>Hypotheses</strong>
</p>



<p>
	Initial state of the case study:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>cell position: internalized embryo 60% epiboly</li>
	<li>polarization field: (verifier sur ancien fichier)</li>
</ul>



<p>
	<strong>Questions</strong>
</p>


<p>
	Background (bio):
</p>


<p>
	The formation of the antero-posterior axis of the embryo is associated with an elongation of the tissue.
</p>


<p>
	Various cellular mechanisms may be responsible for an elongation (growth along a preferential axis):
</p>

<ul>
	<li>cell deformation along the APaxis: C. elegans, Phallusia (ascidians ?)</li>
	<li>active cell rearrangement: chord Pallusia, Drosophila</li>
	<li>oriented cell division, amplified with cell growth: XXXX ??</li>
</ul>

<p>
	During the zebrafish gastrulation, this episode is called Convergence-Extension (CE) (see Review chapitre 6 XXX).
</p>





<h4>Q1. Influence of the division orientation axis on the convergence</h4>







<p>
	-> Is it possible to have a convergence-extension behavior if the division orientation axes are random ? we can test it
</p>


<p>
	-> Does it help to have oriented division axes along the XXXXX ? we can test it
</p>



<p>
	We postulate that cell are re-oriented after division because of the external protrusive activity around them. On peut le montrer en mettant des divisions d'axes random et en plotant la reorientation dû aux actions mechaniques locales (protrusions des voisines.)
</p>




<p>
	Biblio:
</p>


<p>
	<i>In vivo</i> confocal imaging shows that mitotic divisions in the dorsal region of the zebrafish gastrulation are preferentially oriented along the animal vegetal axis and this orientation is a driving force of axis elongation <a name='Gong:2004bw' class='ref'></a> 
</p>


	<p>
		&quot;Xdd1 disrupts convergence and extension of the dorsal tissue (Fig. 4b)11,13. It is thus possible that the disruption of oriented division observed in Xdd1-overexpressing embryos was due to compromised morphogenesis of the tissue. To address this, we generated mosaic clones of Xdd1-expressing cells in a wild-type background by injecting a single cleavage-stage blastomere. Such embryos undergo normal morphogenesis, and are indistinguishable from unmanipulated controls morphologically (data not shown). Subsequent analysis shows that these mosaic Xdd1-expressing cells have randomized division orientation, with angular distribution similar to that of embryos overexpressing Xdd1 ubiquitously (Fig. 3e, f; see Supplementary Information for details). Thus, Dsh has a cell-autonomous function and exerts its effect on division orientation directly.&quot; ... &quot;Our experiments on the zebrafish dorsal epiblast show both a matching of division orientation and axis elongation normally, and a disruption of oriented cell division and axis elongation after inhibition of PCP signalling. We assessed the contribution of oriented cell division to axis elongation.&quot; (Gong, Y., Mo, C. &amp; Fraser, S.E., 2004. Planar cell polarity signalling controls cell division orientation during zebrafish gastrulation. Nature, 430(7000), pp.689–693. <a name='Gong:2004bw' class='ref'></a>) -> still a double, another mechanism, like protrusion, could also be involved. leaving this cell division orientation bias as a side effect. It would be really interesting to check in my simulation if, even with random axis, cell are re-oriented by protrusive mechanism (deactivate protrusion for the dividing cell and check if there is many differences).

<p>
	MZoep mutant does not internalize properly and lacks mesendoderm and structures (notochord, prechordal plate, paraxial/lateral mesendoderm).  
</p>

<p>
	MZoep is a mutant of the Nodal-signaling pathways and the Nodal-dependent gene (XXXX goosecoid,...) are not expressed. see Jia, S. et al., 2009. Smad2/3 activities are required for induction and patterning of the neuroectoderm in zebrafish. Developmental Biology, 333(2), pp.273–284. <a name='Jia:2009ez' class='ref'></a> 
</p>

<p>
	However, its epiblast still performs a CE. 

	Dorsalizing genes are still expressed (XXXXX)

	Its phenotype shows that the cell mass is present at the dorsal side but in a more ventral latitude (show image).
</p>

<p>
	We postulate that the epiblast CE is unaffected by the lack of hypoblast mechanically. Its different phenotype is due to a change in the polarization field in the tissue whose difference correlates with lack of polarization source in the region of the prechorlale plate.
