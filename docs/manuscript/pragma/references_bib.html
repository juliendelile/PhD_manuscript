  abstract = {Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling generates subcellular
  asymmetry along an axis orthogonal to the epithelial apical-basal axis.
  Through a poorly understood mechanism, cell clones that have mutations in
  some PCP signaling components, including some, but not all, alleles of the
  receptor frizzled, cause polarity disruptions of neighboring wild-type cells,
  a phenomenon referred to as domineering nonautonomy. Here, a
  contact-dependent signaling hypothesis, derived from experimental results, is
  shown by reaction-diffusion, partial differential equation modeling and
  simulation to fully reproduce PCP phenotypes, including domineering
  nonautonomy, in the Drosophila wing. The sufficiency of this model and the
  experimental validation of model predictions reveal how specific
  protein-protein interactions produce autonomy or domineering nonautonomy.}

  in the DNA, in the form of organized arrays of transcription factor target

  factors and the target sites for the transcription factors required for the
  control of each gene constitute its cis-regulatory system. These systems are
  remarkably complex. Their hardwired internal organization enables them to
  behave as genomic information processing systems. Developmental gene
  regulatory networks consist of the cis-regulatory systems of all the relevant
  genes and the regulatory linkages amongst them. Though there is yet little
  explicit information, some general properties of genomic regulatory networks
  have become apparent. The key to understanding how genomic regulatory
  networks are organized, and how they work, lies in experimental analysis of
  cis-regulatory systems at all levels of the regulatory network.}

  abstract = {E-cadherin is maternally expressed in most vertebrate species,
  but its function during early development of the vertebrate embryo proper is
  unknown. To directly examine E-cadherin gene (cdh1) function in zebrafish,
  morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) that inhibit E-cadherin protein (Cdh1)
  expression were injected into embryos. Cdh1 knockdown reduced embryo
  survival. In early cdh1 MO-injected embryos, the cleavage plane orientation
  between blastomeres was irregular and adhesion defects prevented normal
  compaction. Cdh1 knockdown inhibited epiboly cell movements. Epiboly delay
  caused yolk cell lysis and produced embryos with a bifurcated embryonic axis.
  Cdh1 knockdown inhibited gastrulation cell movements, causing defects in
  convergence and extension. Additionally, prechordal plate derivatives were
  absent in Cdh1 knockdown embryos even though presumptive prechordal plate
  markers were induced normally. E-cadherin mRNA coinjection demonstrated the
  specificity of cdh1 MO-induced defects. Our experiments illustrate the
  importance of cdh1 in regulating morphogenetic cell movements and tissue
  formation in the early embryo.}

  differentiation and organogenesis. To support proper development, cell
  migration must be regulated both temporally and spatially. Mesoderm cell
  migration in the Drosophila embryo serves as an excellent model system to
  study how cell migration is controlled and influences organogenesis. First,
  mesoderm spreading transforms the embryo into a multilayered form during
  gastrulation and, subsequently, cells originating from the caudal visceral
  mesoderm (CVM) migrate along the entire length of the gut. Here we review our
  studies, which have focused on the role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
  signaling, and compare and contrast these two different cell migration
  processes: mesoderm spreading and CVM migration. In both cases, FGF acts as a
  chemoattractant to guide cells' directional movement but is likely not the
  only signal that serves this role. Furthermore, FGF likely modulates cell
  adhesion properties since FGF mutant phenotypes share similarities with those
  of cell adhesion molecules. Our working hypothesis is that levels of FGF
  signaling differentially influence cells' response to result in either
  directional movement or changes in adhesive properties.}

  abstract = {The invariant cell lineage and cell fate of Caenorhabditis
  elegans provide a unique opportunity to decode the molecular mechanisms of
  animal development. To exploit this opportunity, we have developed a system
  for automated cell lineage tracing during C. elegans embryogenesis, based on
  3D, time-lapse imaging and automated image analysis. Using ubiquitously
  expressed histone-GFP fusion protein to label cells/nuclei and a confocal
  microscope, the imaging protocol captures embryogenesis at high spatial (31
  planes at 1 microm apart) and temporal (every minute) resolution without
  apparent effects on development. A set of image analysis algorithms then
  automatically recognizes cells at each time point, tracks cell movements,
  divisions and deaths over time and assigns cell identities based on the
  canonical naming scheme. Starting from the four-cell stage (or earlier), our
  software, named starrynite, can trace the lineage up to the 350-cell stage in
  25 min on a desktop computer. The few errors of automated lineaging can then
  be corrected in a few hours with a graphic interface that allows easy
  navigation of the images and the reported lineage tree. The system can be
  used to characterize lineage phenotypes of genes and/or extended to determine
  gene expression patterns in a living embryo at the single-cell level. We
  envision that this automation will make it practical to systematically
  decipher the developmental genes and pathways encoded in the genome of C.
  elegans.}

  dynamics of the gap genes hunchback, Kruppel, giant, and knirps, taking as
  regulatory inputs the maternal Bicoid and Caudal gradients, plus the zygotic
  Tailless and Huckebein proteins. The model captures the expression patterns

  inferred network shows an architecture based on reciprocal repression between
  gap genes that can stably pattern the embryo on a realistic geometry but
  requires complex regulations such as those involving the Hunchback monomer
  and dimers. Sensitivity analysis identifies the posterior domain of giant as
  among the most fragile features of an otherwise robust network, and hints at
  redundant regulations by Bicoid and Hunchback, possibly reflecting recent
  evolutionary changes in the gap-gene network in insects.}

  a similar character and therefore can be solved using a common approach. We
  explain in details our semi-implicit time discretization and finite volume

  cell-autonomous requirement for oep in Nodal signaling enabled us to test
  whether internalization can be achieved by individual cells or whether it
  depends on interactions within a group of cells. We found that individual
  MZoep mutant cells transplanted to the margin of wild-type blastula embryos
  initially internalize with their neighbors but are unable to contribute to
  the mesendoderm. In the reciprocal experiment, single wild-type cells
  transplanted to the margin of MZoep mutant embryos autonomously internalize

  Although the intracellular transport mechanisms underlying nuclear movements
  have been studied in detail, relatively little is known about signals from
  surrounding cells and tissues controlling these movements. Here, we show
  that, in gastrulating zebrafish embryos, convergence movements of nuclei
  within the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) are guided by mesoderm and endoderm
  progenitors migrating along the surface of the yolk towards the dorsal side
  of the developing gastrula. Progenitor cells direct the convergence movements
  of internal yolk syncytial nuclei (iYSN) by modulating cortical flow within
  the YSL in which the iYSN are entrained. The effect of mesoderm and endoderm
  progenitors on the convergence movement of iYSN depends on the expression of
  E-cadherin, indicating that adhesive contact between the cells and the YSL is
  required for the mesendoderm-modulated YSL cortical flow mediating nuclear
  convergence. In summary, our data reveal a crucial function for cortical flow
  in the coordination of syncytial nuclear movements with surrounding cells and
  tissues during zebrafish gastrulation.}

  regulated expression of genes encoding transcription factors and signaling
  pathways. Complex networks of regulatory genetic interactions control
  developmental cell specification and fates. Development in the zebrafish,
  Danio rerio, has been studied extensively and large amounts of experimental
  data, including information on spatial and temporal gene expression patterns,
  are available. A wide variety of maternal and zygotic regulatory factors and
  signaling pathways have been discovered in zebrafish, and these provide a
  useful starting point for reconstructing the gene regulatory networks (GRNs)
  underlying development. In this review, we describe in detail the genetic
  regulatory subcircuits responsible for dorsoanterior-ventroposterior
  patterning and endoderm formation. We describe a number of regulatory motifs,
  which appear to act as the functional building blocks of the GRNs. Different
  positive feedback loops drive the ventral and dorsal specification processes.
  Mutual exclusivity in dorsal-ventral polarity in zebrafish is governed by
  intra-cellular cross-inhibiting GRN motifs, including vent/dharma and
  tll1/chordin. The dorsal-ventral axis seems to be determined by competition
  between two maternally driven positive-feedback loops (one operating on
  Dharma, the other on Bmp). This is the first systematic approach aimed at
  developing an integrated model of the GRNs underlying zebrafish development.
  Comparison of GRNs' organizational motifs between different species will
  provide insights into developmental specification and its evolution. The

  development in Drosophila embryos to investigate a buckling phenomenon called
  invagination. The finite element method is used to model this ventral furrow
  formation in 3D by decomposing the total deformation into two parts: an
  imposed active deformation, and an elastic passive deformation superimposed
  onto the latter. The model imposes as boundary conditions (i) a constant yolk
  volume and (ii) a sliding contact condition of the cells against the
  vitelline membrane, which is interpolated as a B-Spline surface. The active
  deformation simulates the effects of apical constriction and apico-basal
  elongation of cells. This set of local cellular mechanisms leads to global
  shape changes of the embryo which are associated with known gene expressions.
  Using the model we have tested different plausible hypotheses postulated to
  account for the mechanical behaviour of epithelial tissues. In particular, we
  conclude that only certain combinations of local cell shape change can
  successfully reproduce the invagination process. We have quantitatively
  compared the model with a 2D model and shown that it exhibits a more robust
  invagination phenomenon. The 3D model has also revealed that invagination
  causes a yolk flow from the central region to the anterior and posterior ends
  of the embryo, causing an accordion-like global compression and expansion
  wave to move through the embryo. Such a phenomenon cannot be described by 2D
  models.}

  abstract = {This chapter focuses on the in vivo macroassembly dynamics of
  fibronectin and fibrillin-2--two prominent extracellular matrix (ECM)
  components, present in vertebrate embryos at the earliest stages of
  development. The ECM is an inherently dynamic structure with a well-defined
  position fate: ECM filaments are not only anchored to and move with
  established tissue boundaries, but are repositioned prior to the formation of
  new anatomical features. We distinguish two ECM filament relocation
  processes-each operating on different length scales. First, ECM filaments are
  moved by large-scale tissue motion, which rearranges major organ primordia
  within the embryo. The second type of motion, on the scale of the individual
  ECM filaments, is driven by local motility and protrusive activity of nearby
  cells. The motion decomposition is made practically possible by recent
  advances in microscopy and high-resolution particle image velocimetry
  algorithms. We demonstrate that both kinds of motion contribute substantially
  to the establishment of normal ECM structure, and both must be taken into
  account when attempting to understand ECM macroassembly during embryonic
  morphogenesis. The tissue-scale motion changes the local amount (density) and
  the tissue-level structure (e.g., orientation) of ECM fibers. Local
  reorganization includes filament assembly and the segregation of ECM into
  specific patterns. Local reorganization takes place most actively at Hensen's
  node and around the primitive streak. These regions are also sites of active
  cell migration, where fibrillin-2 and fibronectin are often colocalized in
  ECM globules, and new fibrillin-2 foci are deposited. During filament
  assembly, the globular patches of ECM are joined into larger linear
  structures in a hierarchical process: increasingly larger structures are
  created by the aggregation of smaller units. A future understanding of ECM
  assembly thus requires the study of the complex interactions between
  biochemical assembly steps, local cell action, and tissue motion.}

  known to play important roles in the induction of cellular mesendoderm, as
  well as the patterning of dorsal tissues. To determine how this
  extraembryonic endodermal compartment is subdivided and morphologically
  transformed during early development, we have examined collective movements
  of vitally stained YSL nuclei in axiating zebrafish embryos by using
  four-dimensional confocal microscopy. During blastulation, gastrulation, and
  early segmentation, zebrafish YSL nuclei display several highly patterned
  movements, which are organized into spatially distinct morphogenetic domains
  along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes. During the late
  blastula period, with the onset of epiboly, nuclei throughout the YSL
  initiate longitudinal movements that are directed along the animal-vegetal
  axis. As epiboly progresses, nuclei progressively recede from the advancing
  margin of the epibolic YSL. However, a small group of nuclei is retained at
  the YSL margin to form a constricting blastoporal ring. During
  mid-gastrulation, YSL nuclei undergo convergent-extension behavior toward the
  dorsal midline, with a subset of nuclei forming an axial domain that
  underlies the notochord. These highly patterned movements of YSL nuclei share
  remarkable similarities to the morphogenetic movements of deep cells in the
  overlying zebrafish blastoderm. The macroscopic shape changes of the
  zebrafish yolk cell, as well as the morphogenetic movements of its YSL
  nuclei, are homologous to several morphogenetic behaviors that are regionally
  expressed within the vegetal endodermal cell mass of gastrulating Xenopus
  embryos. In contrast to the cellular endoderm of Xenopus, the dynamics of
  zebrafish YSL show that a syncytial endodermal germ layer can express a
  temporal sequence of morphogenetic domains without undergoing progressive
  steps of cell fate restriction.}

  abstract = {In vertebrates the endoderm germ layer gives rise to most tissues
  of the digestive tract and controls head and heart morphogenesis. The
  induction of endoderm development relies on extracellular signals related to
  Nodals and propagated intracellularly by TGFbeta type I receptors
  ALK4/Taram-A. It is unclear, however, whether Nodal/ALK4/Taram-A signalling
  is involved only in the specification of endodermal precursors or plays a
  more comprehensive role in the activation of the endodermal program leading
  to the irreversible commitment of cells to the endodermal fate. Using cell
  transplantation experiments in zebrafish, we show that marginal cells become
  committed to endoderm at the onset of gastrulation and that commitment to
  endoderm can be reached by intracellular activation of the Nodal pathway
  induced by expression of an activated form of the taram-A receptor, Tar*. In
  a manner similar to endoderm progenitors, Tar*-activated blastomeres
  translocate from their initial site of implantation in the blastoderm to
  reach the surface of their migration substratum, the yolk syncitial layer,
  where they join endogenous endodermal derivatives during gastrulation and
  differentiate according to their anteroposterior position. We demonstrate
  that Nodal/Tar*-induced commitment does not rely on a secondary signal
  released by Tar*-expressing cells or a signal released by endogenous endoderm
  since Tar*-expressing wild-type cells can restore endoderm derivatives when
  transplanted into the endoderm-deficient mutant casanova. Likewise, the YSL
  does not appear essential for the maintenance of endodermal identity during
  gastrulation once the Nodal pathway has been activated. Thus, our results
  demonstrate that the activation of Nodal signalling is sufficient to commit
  cells both to an endodermal fate and behaviour. Wild-type endoderm
  implantation into casanova embryos rescues, in a non-autonomous fashion, the
  defective fusion of the two heart primordia in the midline, highlighting the
  importance of endoderm for normal heart morphogenesis.}

  are considered with focus on those aspects that provide insight into how cell
  specification occurs in the initial stages of development. There appear to be
  three major types of embryogenesis: Type 1, a general form characteristic of
  most invertebrate taxa of today, in which lineage plays an important role in
  the spatial organization of the early embryo, and cell specification occurs
  in situ, by both autonomous and conditional mechanisms; Type 2, the
  vertebrate form of embryogenesis, which proceeds by mechanisms that are
  essentially independent of cell lineage, in which diffusible morphogens and
  extensive early cell migration are particularly important; Type 3, the form
  exemplified by long germ band insects in which several different regulatory
  mechanisms are used to generate precise patterns of nuclear gene expression
  prior to cellularization. Evolutionary implications of the phylogenetic
  distribution of these types of embryogenesis are considered. Regionally
  expressed homeodomain regulators are utilized in all three types of embryo,
  in similar ways in later and postembryonic development, but in different ways
  in early embryonic development. A specific downstream molecular function for
  this class of regulator is proposed, based on evidence obtained in vertebrate
  systems. This provides a route by which to approach the comparative

  abstract = {Collective cell migration is key to morphogenesis, wound healing,
  or cancer cell migration. However, its cellular bases are just starting to be
  unraveled. During vertebrate gastrulation, axial mesendoderm migrates in a
  group, the prechordal plate, from the embryonic organizer to the animal pole.
  How this collective migration is achieved remains unclear. Previous work has
  suggested that cells migrate as individuals, with collective movement
  resulting from the addition of similar individual cell behavior. Through
  extensive analyses of cell trajectories, morphologies, and polarization in
  zebrafish embryos, we reveal that all prechordal plate cells show the same
  behavior and rely on the same signaling pathway to migrate, as expected if
  they do so individually. However, by using cell transplants, we demonstrate
  that prechordal plate migration is a true collective process, as isolated
  cells do not migrate toward the animal pole. They are still polarized and
  motile but lose directionality. Directionality is restored upon contact with
  the endogenous prechordal plate. This contact dependent orientation relies on
  E-cadherin, Wnt-PCP signaling, and Rac1. Importantly, groups of cells also
  need contact with the endogenous plate to orient correctly, showing an
  instructive role of the plate in establishing directionality. Overall, our
  results lead to an original model of collective migration in which
  directional information is contained within the moving group rather than
  provided by extrinsic cues, and constantly maintained in cells by contacts
  with their neighbors. This self-organizing model could account for collective
  invasion of new territories, as observed in cancer strands, without
  requirement for any attractant in the colonized tissue.}

  ectopic force and relieving tension leads to a rapid loss of myosin,

  it operates at various scales, from the intracellular to organismal. Genes
  and molecules set up the conditions for the physical processes to act, in
  particular to shape the embryo. As development continues the changes brought
  about by the physical processes lead to changes in gene expression. It is
  this coordinated interplay between genetic and generic (i.e., physical and
  chemical) processes that constitutes the modern understanding of early
  morphogenesis. It is natural to assume that in this multiscale process the
  smaller defines the larger. In case of biophysical properties, in particular,
  those at the subcellular level are expected to give rise to those at the
  tissue level and beyond. Indeed, the physical properties of tissues vary
  greatly from the liquid to solid. Very little is known at present on how
  tissue level properties are related to cell and subcellular properties.
  Modern measurement techniques provide quantitative results at both the
  intracellular and tissue level, but not on the connection between these. In
  the present work we outline a framework to address this connection. We
  specifically concentrate on the morphogenetic process of tissue fusion, by
  following the coalescence of two contiguous multicellular aggregates. The
  time evolution of this process can accurately be described by the theory of
  viscous liquids. We also study fusion by Monte Carlo simulations and a novel
  Cellular Particle Dynamics (CPD) model, which is similar to the earlier
  introduced Subcellular Element Model (SEM; Newman, 2005). Using the
  combination of experiments, theory and modeling we are able to relate the
  measured tissue level biophysical quantities to subcellular parameters. Our
  approach has validity beyond the particular morphogenetic process considered
  here and provides a general way to relate biophysical properties across
  scales.}

  interpreted in terms of elasto-plastic flow of sheets. Such a model allows
  one to calculate the flow map inside the blastodisc, hence the evolution of
  its shape. In addition, the model predicts that there exists a region of high
  stress oriented radially from the caudal pole towards the center of the
  blastodisc, with a tensile component oriented orthoradially. If the stress
  generated by cellular motion is enough to provoke a crack in the extra
  cellular matrix, then mesoderm ingression proceeds through a "streak" (the
  primitive streak) oriented from the caudal pole inwards, which relieves the
  stress while it creates the three germ layers. The model predicts that crack
  opening is next followed by crack retreat (primitive streak retreat), as
  mesoderm ingression continues. As mesoderm ingression proceeds around the
  area pellucida, similar phenomena in the anterior pole may contribute to
  formation of the embryo. This gives a mechanical description of avian
  gastrulation which complements the biochemical approach. In addition, the
  model provides a simple explanation to the shape of the embryo at very early
  stages, and possibly an explanation of the entry point of the vitteline
  arteries into the mesoderm.}

  question. It is not clear whether the existence of different structures, such
  as a head, can be addressed by fundamental laws of tissue movement and
  deformation, or whether they are only a sequence of stop-and-go genetic
  instructions. I have filmed by time-lapse microscopy the formation of the
  presumptive head territory in chicken embryos. I show that the early lateral
  evagination of the eye cups and of the mesencephalic plate is a consequence
  of a sudden change in boundary conditions of the initial cell flow occurring
  in these embryos. Due to tissue flow, and collision of the two halves of the
  embryo, the tissue sheet movement is first dipolar, and next quadrupolar. In
  vivo air puff tonometry reveals a simple visco-elastic behaviour of the
  living material. The jump from a dipolar to a quadrupolar flow changes the
  topology of the early morphogenetic field which is observed towards a complex
  vortex winding with a trail (the eye cups and brain folds). The
  hydrodynamical model accounts for the discontinuity of the vector field at
  the moment of collision of the left and right halves of the embryo, at a
  quantitative level. This suggests a possible mechanism for the morphogenesis
  of the head of amniotes, as compared to cephalochordates and anamniotes.}

  Differentiation of the EVL requires the maternal effect gene poky/ikk1 in EVL
  cells prior to establishment of the basal layer. This requirement is
  transient and maternal Ikk1 is sufficient to allow establishment of the EVL
  and formation of normal skin in adults. Similar to the requirement for Ikk1
  in mouse epidermis, EVL cells in poky mutants fail to exit the cell cycle or
  express specific markers of differentiation. In spite of the similarity in
  phenotype, the molecular requirement for Ikk1 is different between mouse and
  zebrafish. Unlike the mouse, EVL differentiation requires functioning
  Poky/Ikk1 kinase activity but does not require the HLH domain. Previous work
  suggested that the EVL was a transient embryonic structure, and that
  maturation of the epidermis required replacement of the EVL with cells from
  the basal layer. We show here that the EVL is not lost during embryogenesis
  but persists to larval stages. Our results show that while the requirement
  for poky/ikk1 is conserved, the differences in molecular activity indicate
  that diversification of an epithelial differentiation program has allowed at

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut formation is a key event during animal
  development. Recent genetic analysis in chick, mice, and Drosophila has
  identified Hedgehog and TGFbeta signals as essential players for the
  development of the primitive gut tube along its anterior-posterior (AP) axis.
  However, the genetic programs that control gut patterning along its
  dorsoventral (DV) axis have remained largely elusive. RESULTS: We demonstrate
  that the activation of the Notch receptor occurs in a single row of boundary
  cells which separates dorsal from ventral cells in the Drosophila hindgut.
  rhomboid, which encodes a transmembrane protein, and knirps/knirps-related,
  which encode nuclear steroid receptors, are Notch target genes required for
  the expression of crumbs, which encodes a transmembrane protein involved in
  organizing apical-basal polarity. Notch receptor activation depends on the
  expression of its ligand Delta in ventral cells, and localizing the Notch
  receptor to the apical domain of the boundary cells may be required for
  proper signaling. The analysis of gene expression mediated by a Notch
  response element suggests that boundary cell-specific expression can be
  obtained by cooperation of Suppressor of Hairless and the transcription
  factor Grainyhead or a related factor. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate
  that Notch signaling plays a pivotal role in determining cell fates along the
  DV axis of the Drosophila hindgut. The finding that Notch signaling results
  in the expression of an apical polarity organizer which may be required, in
  turn, for apical Notch receptor localization suggests a simple mechanism by
  which the specification of a single cell row might be controlled.}

  during oogenesis through differential maternal RNA localization. The RNA of
  the anterior morphogen bicoid is localized to the anterior pole of the
  embryo, where bicoid protein controls head and thorax development. The RNA of
  the posterior morphogen nanos is localized to the posterior pole, where nanos
  protein is required for abdomen formation. Here we show that the nanos 3'
  untranslated region, like that of the bicoid RNA, is sufficient for RNA
  localization. We have used the bicoid RNA localization signal to mislocalize
  nanos, producing embryos with two sources of nanos protein. Such embryos form
  two abdomens with mirror image symmetry. Embryos with nanos RNA localized
  only to the anterior have greater nanos gene activity than embryos with nanos
  RNA localized posteriorly. We propose a role for RNA localization in
  regulating nanos activity.}

  strongly influences the orientation of the mitotic cleavage plane (e.g.,

  interplay between cell shape and cleavage-plane orientation in epithelia,
  where polygonal cell geometries emerge from multiple factors, including cell
  packing, cell growth, and cell division itself. Here, using mechanical
  simulations, we show that the polygonal shapes of individual cells can
  systematically bias the long-axis orientations of their adjacent mitotic
  neighbors. Strikingly, analyses of both animal epithelia and plant epidermis
  confirm a robust and nearly identical correlation between local cell topology
  and cleavage-plane orientation in vivo. Using simple mathematics, we show
  that this effect derives from fundamental packing constraints. Our results
  suggest that local epithelial topology is a key determinant of cleavage-plane
  orientation, and that cleavage-plane bias may be a widespread property of
  polygonal cell sheets in plants and animals.}

  factors. Branches initiated from sites of high mechanical stress within the
  tissues, as predicted numerically and measured directly using 3D traction
  force microscopy. Branch sites were defined by activation of focal adhesion

  activation, and branching were all altered by manipulating cellular
  contractility, matrix stiffness, intercellular cohesion and tissue geometry.
  These data suggest that the pattern and magnitude of mechanical stress across
  epithelial tissues cooperate with biochemical signals to specify branching
  pattern.}

  In many organisms, specification of the dorsoventral axis requires signalling
  by proteins of the Transforming growth factor-beta and Wnt families. Here we
  show that maternal transcripts of the zebrafish Nodal-related morphogen,
  Squint (Sqt), can localize to two blastomeres at the four-cell stage and
  predict the dorsal axis. Removal of cells containing sqt transcripts from
  four-to-eight-cell embryos or injection of antisense morpholino
  oligonucleotides targeting sqt into oocytes can cause a loss of dorsal
  structures. Localization of sqt transcripts is independent of maternal Wnt
  pathway function and requires a highly conserved sequence in the 3'
  untranslated region. Thus, the dorsoventral axis is apparent by early
  cleavage stages and may require the maternally encoded morphogen Sqt and its
  associated factors. Because the 3' untranslated region of the human nodal
  gene can also localize exogenous sequences to dorsal cells, this mechanism
  may be evolutionarily conserved.}

  and interconnected networks. Such a pattern can be described as a list of
  links between neighbouring sites. Performing statistics on the links between
  neighbouring sites yields average quantities (hereafter "tools") as the
  result of direct measurements on images. These descriptive tools are flexible
  and suitable for various problems where quantitative measurements are
  required, whether in two or in three dimensions. Here, we present a coherent
  set of robust tools, in three steps. First, we revisit the definitions of
  three existing tools based on the texture matrix. Second, thanks to their
  more general definition, we embed these three tools in a self-consistent
  formalism, which includes three additional ones. Third, we show that the six
  tools together provide a direct correspondence between a small scale, where
  they quantify the discrete pattern's local distortion and rearrangements, and
  a large scale, where they help describe a material as a continuous medium.
  This enables to formulate elastic, plastic, fluid behaviours in a common,
  self-consistent modelling using continuous mechanics. Experiments,
  simulations and models can be expressed in the same language and directly
  compared. As an example, a companion paper (P. Marmottant, C. Raufaste, and

  localized at the anterior pole. Gradients of Bcd and other morphogens are
  thought to arise through diffusion, but this basic assumption has never been
  rigorously tested in living embryos. Furthermore, because diffusion sets a
  relationship between length and time scales, it is hard to see how patterns
  of gene expression established by diffusion would scale proportionately as
  egg size changes during evolution. Here, we show that the motion of inert
  molecules through the embryo is well described by the diffusion equation on
  the relevant length and time scales, and that effective diffusion constants
  are essentially the same in closely related dipteran species with embryos of
  very different size. Nonetheless, patterns of gene expression in these
  different species scale with egg length. We show that this scaling can be
  traced back to scaling of the Bcd gradient itself. Our results, together with
  constraints imposed by the time scales of development, suggest that the
  mechanism for scaling is a species-specific adaptation of the Bcd lifetime.}

  abstract = {In the past few decades, it has become increasingly popular and
  important to utilize mathematical models to understand how microscopic
  intercellular interactions lead to the macroscopic pattern formation
  ubiquitous in the biological world. Modeling methodologies come in a large
  variety and presently it is unclear what is their interrelationship and the
  assumptions implicit in their use. They can be broadly divided into three
  categories according to the spatial scale they purport to describe: the
  molecular, the cellular and the tissue scales. Most models address dynamics
  at the tissue-scale, few address the cellular scale and very few address the
  molecular scale. Of course there would be no dissent between models or at
  least the underlying assumptions would be known if they were all rigorously
  derived from a molecular level model, in which case the laws of physics and
  chemistry are very well known. However in practice this is not possible due
  to the immense complexity of the problem. A simpler approach is to derive
  models at a coarse scale from an intermediate scale model which has the
  special property of being based on biology and physics which are
  experimentally well studied. In this article we use such an approach to
  understand the assumptions inherent in the use of the most popular models,
  the tissue-level ones. Such models are found to invariably rely on the hidden
  assumption that statistical correlations between cells can be neglected. This
  often means that the predictions of these models are qualitatively correct
  but may fail in spatial regions where cell concentration is small,
  particularly if there are strong long-range correlations in cell movement.
  Such behavior can only be properly taken into account by cellular models.
  However such models unlike the tissue-level models are frequently not easily
  amenable to analysis, except when the number of interacting cells is small or
  when the interactions are weak, and thus are rather more suited for
  simulation. Hence it is our conclusion that the simultaneous theoretical and
  numerical analysis of models of the same biological system at different
  spatial scales provides a more robust method of understanding biological
  systems than the utilization of a single scale model. In particular this
  enables one to clearly separate nonphysical predictions stemming from model
  artifacts from those due to genuine physiological behavior.}

  The current framework emphasizes the key role of the nuclear lamina in

  controls nuclear deformations and how this stress interplays with properties
  of the NE to control NE dynamics is unclear. We address this in the early
  Drosophila embryo, in which profound changes in NE shape parallel the
  transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. We show that microtubule
  (MT) polymerization events produce the elementary forces necessary for NE
  dynamics. Moreover, large-scale NE deformations associated with groove
  formation require concentration of MT polymerization in bundles organized by
  Dynein. However, MT bundles cannot produce grooves when the farnesylated
  inner nuclear membrane protein Kugelkern (Kuk) is absent. Although it
  increases stiffness of the NE, Kuk also stabilizes NE deformations emerging
  from the collective effect of MT polymerization forces concentrated in
  bundles. Finally, we report that MT-induced NE deformations control the
  dynamics of chromatin and its organization at steady state. Thus, the NE is a
  dynamic organelle, fluctuations of which increase chromatin dynamics. We
  propose that such mechanical regulation of chromatin dynamics by MTs might be
  important for gene regulation.}

  consequence of the restricted production of the secreted factor FGF8. FGF8 is
  transcribed specifically in the caudal precursor region and is down-regulated
  as cells differentiate and the embryo extends caudally. We are interested in
  understanding the progressive down-regulation of FGF8 and its coordination
  with the caudal movement of cells which is also known to be FGF-signaling
  dependent. Our study is performed using mathematical modeling and computer
  simulations. We use an individual-based hybrid model as well as a caricature
  continuous model for the simulation of experimental observations (ours and
  those known from the literature) in order to examine possible mechanisms that
  drive differentiation and cell movement during the axis elongation. Using
  these models we have identified a possible gene regulatory network involving
  self-repression of a caudal morphogen coupled to directional domain movement
  that may account for progressive down-regulation of FGF8 and conservation of
  the FGF8 domain of expression. Furthermore, we have shown that chemotaxis
  driven by molecules, such as FGF8 secreted in the stem zone, could underlie
  the migration of the caudal precursor zone and, therefore, embryonic axis
  extension. These mechanisms may also be at play in other developmental
  processes displaying a similar mode of axis extension coupled to cell
  differentiation.}

  long been controversial. Whereas some claim prepatterning in the egg, we
  recently presented evidence that mouse embryonic polarity is not established
  until blastocyst and proposed the mechanical constraint model. Here we apply
  computer simulation to clarify the minimal cellular properties required for
  this morphology. The simulation is based on three assumptions: (1) behavior
  of cell aggregates is simulated by a 3D vertex dynamics model; (2) all cells
  have equivalent mechanical properties; (3) an inner cavity with equivalent
  surface properties is gradually enlarged. However, an initial attempt reveals
  a requirement for an additional assumption: (4) the surface of the cavity is
  firmer than intercellular surfaces, suggesting the presence of a basement
  membrane lining the blastocyst cavity, which is indeed confirmed by published
  data. The simulation thus successfully produces a structure recapitulating
  the mouse blastocyst. The axis of the blastocyst, however, remains variable,
  leading us to an additional assumption: (5) the aggregate is enclosed by a
  capsule, equivalent to the zona pellucida in vivo. Whereas a spherical
  capsule does not stabilize the blastocyst axis, an ellipsoidal capsule
  eventually orients the axis in accordance with its longest diameter. These
  predictions are experimentally verified by time-lapse recordings of mouse
  embryos. During simulation, equivalent cells form two distinct populations
  composed of smaller inner cells and larger outer cells. These results reveal
  a unique feature of early mammalian development: an asymmetry may emerge
  autonomously in an equivalent population with no need for a priori intrinsic
  differences.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many species form extraembryonic tissues during
  embryogenesis, such as the placenta of humans and other viviparous mammals.
  Extraembryonic tissues have various roles in protecting, nourishing and
  patterning embryos. Prior to gastrulation in zebrafish, the yolk syncytial
  layer - an extraembryonic nuclear syncytium - produces signals that induce
  mesoderm and endoderm formation. Mesoderm and endoderm precursor cells are
  situated in the embryonic margin, an external ring of cells along the
  embryo-yolk interface. The yolk syncytial layer initially forms below the
  margin, in a domain called the external yolk syncytial layer (E-YSL).
  RESULTS: We hypothesize that key components of the yolk syncytial layer's
  mesoderm and endoderm inducing activity are expressed as mRNAs in the E-YSL.
  To identify genes expressed in the E-YSL, we used microarrays to compare the
  transcription profiles of intact pre-gastrula embryos with pre-gastrula
  embryonic cells that we had separated from the yolk and yolk syncytial layer.
  This identified a cohort of genes with enriched expression in intact embryos.
  Here we describe our whole mount in situ hybridization analysis of
  sixty-eight of them. This includes ten genes with E-YSL expression
  (camsap1l1, gata3, znf503, hnf1ba, slc26a1, slc40a1, gata6, gpr137bb, otop1
  and cebpa), four genes with expression in the enveloping layer (EVL), a
  superficial epithelium that protects the embryo (zgc:136817, zgc:152778,
  slc14a2 and elovl6l), three EVL genes whose expression is transiently
  confined to the animal pole (elovl6l, zgc:136359 and clica), and six genes
  with transient maternal expression (mtf1, wu:fj59f04, mospd2, rftn2, arrdc1a
  and pho). We also assessed the requirement of Nodal signaling for the
  expression of selected genes in the E-YSL, EVL and margin. Margin expression
  was Nodal dependent for all genes we tested, including the concentrated
  margin expression of an EVL gene: zgc:110712. All other instances of EVL and
  E-YSL expression that we tested were Nodal independent. CONCLUSION: We have
  devised an effective strategy for enriching and identifying genes expressed
  in the E-YSL of pre-gastrula embryos. To our surprise, maternal genes and
  genes expressed in the EVL were also enriched by this strategy. A number of
  these genes are promising candidates for future functional studies on early
  embryonic patterning.}

  mechanotransduction - that is, by translating mechanical forces and

  calcium concentration or by activating diverse signalling pathways. In turn,
  these signals can adjust cellular and extracellular structure. This

  migration, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and is crucial for

  cell cortex contraction. Using the experimentally observed distributions of

  three, spatially separate mitotic domains arise with distinctive cycle
  lengths and rhythms. As in Drosophila and at about the equivalent stage, the
  mitotic domains reflect the fate map, but they do so only very crudely: two
  are extraembryonic and the third forms the entire embryo. The domains appear
  not to subdivide during gastrulation, when the germ layers form and when
  cells probably commit to their eventual fates. The domains may signal
  specification of morphogenesis rather than cell fate, because, shortly after
  they appear, each assumes a different role during epiboly, the first
  morphogenetic movement of the embryo. During meroblastic cleavage, and
  continuing in the early blastula, zebrafish blastomeres divide rapidly and
  synchronously. At the time of the tenth cleavage, the beginning of the
  midblastula transition, the cell cycle lengthens, and, as in Xenopus and
  Drosophila, cycle length comes under nucleocytoplasmic control (D.A.K. and
  C.B.K., manuscript in preparation). This nucleocytoplasmic control seems to
  be maintained during cycle lengthening in the next 2 or 3 cycles, comprising
  a midblastula transition period. We now show that functionally distinct
  subsets of cells that arise during this period have reproducibly different
  mitotic cycle lengths.}

  decrease in the number of marginal cells was due to ingression, cell death,
  or rearrangement of cells, marginal and submarginal regions of the late
  gastrula were observed directly by time-lapse cinemicrography. Marginal cells
  rearrange to occupy submarginal positions by first narrowing their boundary
  with the external yolk syncytial layer (E-YSL), thus becoming tapered in
  shape. Then, the narrowed marginal boundary retracts from the E-YSL and moves
  submarginally in the plane of the epithelium. Concurrently, the marginal
  cells on both sides come into apposition; no gap or break appears in the
  circum-apical continuity of the epithelial sheet. Marginal cells leave the
  margin of the EVL during epiboly at a rate of about six per hour. The rate of
  movement of the EVL cells with respect to one another is about 0.5 to 1.0
  micron/min at 21 degrees C. Submarginal cells rearrange in a similar fashion.
  Although no protrusive activity was seen at the lateral aspects of
  rearranging cells, the tapering or narrowing associated with rearrangement
  was accompanied by formation of microfolds on their apical surfaces, and
  separating or recently separated submarginal cells form "flowers" of
  microfolds on their apices adjacent to the site of separation. Morphometric
  analysis shows that about half the narrowing of the margin of the EVL during
  epiboly is accounted for by cell rearrangement and the other half by the
  associated tapering and narrowing. These results suggest that epiboly of the
  EVL may have an active component as well as a passive one.}

  cytoplasm underlying the cellular blastoderm at one pole of the giant yolk
  cell. It forms at the time of the 10th (sometimes 9th) cleavage by a collapse
  of a set of blastomeres, termed marginal blastomeres, into the yolk cell.
  Marginal blastomeres possess cytoplasmic bridges to the yolk cell before the
  YSL forms, and injections of fluorescein-dextran into the cells revealed that
  bridges between the yolk cell and blastoderm do not persist after this time.
  Injections of Lucifer yellow revealed that shortly after the YSL forms the
  yolk cell and blastoderm are dye coupled, presumably by gap junctions, and
  that this coupling disappears gradually during early gastrulation. Lineage
  analyses revealed that not all of the progeny of early marginal blastomeres
  participate in YSL formation. Although some descendants of marginal
  blastomeres remained on the margin during successive cleavages, neither
  "compartment" nor "strict lineage" models are sufficient to explain the
  origin of the YSL. It is proposed that the position of a cell on the

  zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio have been described. Because of the optical
  clarity of the embryo, lineages of selected cells can be followed directly by
  microscopy through many cell divisions. Also, it is shown here that the
  fluorescent molecules fluorescein-dextran and rhodamine-horseradish
  peroxidase can be used as cell lineage tracers, marking the clonal progeny of
  founding blastomeres. The labeled cells can be easily visualized in the live
  embryo, and utilizing a sensitive video camera to amplify fluorescence, the
  same clone may be examined repeatedly while the cells divide and migrate.
  Cells that descend from a single blastomere remain closely associated
  together through the end of the blastula stage. At the time when epiboly
  begins (early gastrula) cells in the labeled clone scatter and become
  dispersed among unlabeled cells. It has been observed that there is no
  invariant mapping of the embryo's midline (determined by the position of the
  embryonic shield in the gastrula) with respect to the early planes of
  cleavage. This finding shows that in the zebrafish the region of the embryo
  that a cell will occupy is not specified by the cell's early ancestory.}

  was found that during epiboly of the zebrafish embryo, the movement of the

  constriction of marginal cells. This process depends on the recruitment of
  actin and myosin 2 within the yolk cytoplasm along the margin of the
  enveloping layer. Actin and myosin 2 recruitment within the yolk cytoplasm
  requires the Ste20-like kinase Msn1, an orthologue of Drosophila Misshapen.
  Similarly, in Drosophila, actin and myosin 2 localization and cell
  constriction at the margin of the epidermis mediate dorsal closure and are
  controlled by Misshapen. Thus, this study has characterized a conserved

  Various hypotheses explain cell sorting and tissue organization on the basis

  validating these hypotheses has been difficult due to the lack of appropriate
  tools to measure these parameters. Here we use atomic force microscopy (AFM)
  to quantify the adhesive and mechanical properties of individual ectoderm,
  mesoderm and endoderm progenitor cells from gastrulating zebrafish embryos.
  Combining these data with tissue self-assembly in vitro and the sorting
  behaviour of progenitors in vivo, we have shown that differential
  actomyosin-dependent cell-cortex tension, regulated by
  Nodal/TGFbeta-signalling (transforming growth factor beta), constitutes a key
  factor that directs progenitor-cell sorting. These results demonstrate a
  previously unrecognized role for Nodal-controlled cell-cortex tension in
  germ-layer organization during gastrulation.}

  scanning microscopy (LSM) of living zebrafish embryos, with a goal to
  identify the optimal filtering method and its parameters. In the large scale
  applications dealing with analysis of 3D+time embryogenesis images, an
  important objective is a correct detection of the number and position of cell
  nuclei yielding the spatio-temporal cell lineage tree of embryogenesis. The
  filtering is the first and necessary step of the image analysis chain and
  must lead to correct results, removing the noise, sharpening the nuclei edges
  and correcting the acquisition errors related to spuriously connected
  subregions. In this paper we study such properties for the regularized
  Perona-Malik model and for the generalized mean curvature flow equations in
  the level-set formulation. A comparison with other nonlinear diffusion
  filters, like tensor anisotropic diffusion and Beltrami flow, is also
  included. All numerical schemes are based on the same discretization
  principles, i.e. finite volume method in space and semi-implicit scheme in
  time, for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. These numerical
  schemes are unconditionally stable, fast and naturally parallelizable. The
  filtering results are evaluated and compared first using the Mean Hausdorff
  distance between a gold standard and different isosurfaces of original and
  filtered data. Then, the number of isosurface connected components in a
  region of interest (ROI) detected in original and after the filtering is
  compared with the corresponding correct number of nuclei in the gold
  standard. Such analysis proves the robustness and reliability of the edge
  preserving nonlinear diffusion filtering for this type of data and lead to
  finding the optimal filtering parameters for the studied models and numerical
  schemes. Further comparisons consist in ability of splitting the very close
  objects which are artificially connected due to acquisition error
  intrinsically linked to physics of LSM. In all studied aspects it turned out
  that the nonlinear diffusion filter which is called geodesic mean curvature
  flow (GMCF) has the best performance.}

  tyrosine kinases, cadherins, and matrix metalloproteinases. While our
  knowledge of how these proteins impact cell polarity and migration has
  advanced considerably in the last decade, almost no data exist regarding the
  organization of extracellular matrix (ECM) during zebrafish gastrulation.
  Here, we describe for the first time the assembly of a fibronectin (FN) and
  laminin containing ECM in the early zebrafish embryo. This matrix was first
  detected at early gastrulation (65% epiboly) in the form of punctae that
  localize to tissue boundaries separating germ layers from each other and the
  underlying yolk cell. Fibrillogenesis increased after mid-gastrulation (80%
  epiboly) coinciding with the period of planar cell polarity pathway-dependent
  convergence and extension cell movements. We demonstrate that FN fibrils
  present beneath deep mesodermal cells are aligned in the direction of
  membrane protrusion formation. Utilizing antisense morpholino
  oligonucleotides, we further show that knockdown of FN expression causes a
  convergence and extension defect. Taken together, our data show that similar
  to amphibian embryos, the formation of ECM in the zebrafish gastrula is a
  dynamic process that occurs in parallel to at least a portion of the
  polarized cell behaviors shaping the embryonic body plan. These results
  provide a framework for uncovering the interrelationship between ECM
  structure and cellular processes regulating convergence and extension such as
  directed migration and mediolateral/radial intercalation.}

  based on the following profiles: (i) those enriched in marks of active genes
  (H3K9ac, H4ac, H3K4me3) without transcriptionally repressing H3K9me3 or
  H3K27me3; (ii) those enriched in H3K9ac, H4ac and H3K27me3, without H3K9me3;
  one such gene was klf4, shown by in situ hybridization to be mosaically
  expressed, likely accounting for the detection of both activating and
  repressive marks on its promoter; (iii) those enriched in H3K4me3 and
  H3K27me3 without acetylation; and (iv) those enriched in all histone
  modifications examined. Culture of embryo-derived cells under differentiation
  conditions leads to H3K9 and H4 deacetylation and H3K9 and H3K27
  trimethylation on genes that are inactivated, yielding an epigenetic profile
  similar to those of fibroblasts or muscle. All promoters however retain
  H3K4me3, indicating an uncoupling of H3K4me3 occupancy and gene expression.
  All non-CpG island developmentally-regulated promoters are DNA unmethylated
  in embryos, but hypermethylated in fibroblasts. Our results suggest that
  differentially expressed embryonic genes are regulated by various patterns of
  histone modifications on unmethylated DNA, which create a developmentally
  permissive chromatin state.}

  3-lobed rudiment is deformed by three inwardly directed point forces.
  Relationships between the physical parameters of the model (tissue viscosity,
  clefting force, surface tension) and the time course and morphology are
  explored. We find that the surface tension, clefting force, and viscosity
  ratio of the two tissues have significant effects on the branching. We

  occur, which involve the rearrangement, mutual spreading, and
  compartmentalization of cell populations in specific configurations.
  Morphogenetic cell rearrangements such as cell sorting and mutual tissue
  spreading have been compared with the behaviors of immiscible liquids, which
  they closely resemble. Based on this similarity, it has been proposed that
  tissues behave as liquids and possess a characteristic surface tension, which
  arises as a collective, macroscopic property of groups of mobile, cohering
  cells. But how are tissue surface tensions generated? Different theories have
  been proposed to explain how mesoscopic cell properties such as cell-cell
  adhesion and contractility of cell interfaces may underlie tissue surface
  tensions. Although recent work suggests that both may be contributors, an
  explicit model for the dependence of tissue surface tension on these
  mesoscopic parameters has been missing. Here we show explicitly that the
  ratio of adhesion to cortical tension determines tissue surface tension. Our
  minimal model successfully explains the available experimental data and makes
  predictions, based on the feedback between mechanical energy and geometry,
  about the shapes of aggregate surface cells, which we verify experimentally.
  This model indicates that there is a crossover from adhesion dominated to
  cortical-tension dominated behavior as a function of the ratio between these
  two quantities.}

  abstract = {Cell aggregates are a tool for in vitro studies of morphogenesis,
  cancer invasion, and tissue engineering. They respond to mechanical forces as
  a complex rather than simple liquid. To change an aggregate's shape, cells
  have to overcome energy barriers. If cell shape fluctuations are active
  enough, the aggregate spontaneously relaxes stresses ("fluctuation-induced
  flow"). If not, changing the aggregate's shape requires a sufficiently large
  applied stress ("stress-induced flow"). To capture this distinction, we
  develop a mechanical model of aggregates based on their cellular structure.
  At stress lower than a characteristic stress tau*, the aggregate as a whole
  flows with an apparent viscosity eta*, and at higher stress it is a
  shear-thinning fluid. An increasing cell-cell tension results in a higher
  eta* (and thus a slower stress relaxation time t(c)). Our constitutive
  equation fits experiments of aggregate shape relaxation after compression or
  decompression in which irreversibility can be measured; we find t(c) of the
  order of 5 h for F9 cell lines. Predictions also match numerical simulations
  of cell geometry and fluctuations. We discuss the deviations from liquid
  behavior, the possible overestimation of surface tension in parallel-plate
  compression measurements, and the role of measurement duration.}

  are integrated across the tissue. Reducing adherens junction (AJ) levels or
  ablating actomyosin meshworks causes tissue-wide epithelial tears, which
  release tension that is predominantly oriented along the anterior-posterior
  (a-p) embryonic axis. Epithelial tears allow cells normally elongated along
  the a-p axis to constrict isotropically, which suggests that apical
  constriction generates anisotropic epithelial tension that feeds back to
  control cell shape. Epithelial tension requires the transcription factor
  Twist, which stabilizes apical myosin II, promoting the formation of a
  supracellular actomyosin meshwork in which radial actomyosin fibers are
  joined end-to-end at spot AJs. Thus, pulsed actomyosin contractions require a
  supracellular, tensile meshwork to transmit cellular forces to the tissue
  level during morphogenesis.}

  abstract = {Interactions between Nodal/Activin and Fibroblast growth factor
  (Fgf) signalling pathways have long been thought to play an important role in
  mesoderm formation. However, the molecular and cellular processes underlying
  these interactions have remained elusive. Here, we address the epistatic
  relationships between Nodal and Fgf pathways during early embryogenesis in
  zebrafish. First, we find that Fgf signalling is required downstream of Nodal
  signals for inducing the Nodal co-factor One-eyed-pinhead (Oep). Thus, Fgf is
  likely to be involved in the amplification and propagation of Nodal
  signalling during early embryonic stages. This could account for the
  previously described ability of Fgf to render cells competent to respond to
  Nodal/Activin signals. In addition, overexpression data shows that Fgf8 and
  Fgf3 can take part in this process. Second, combining zygotic mutations in
  ace/fgf8 and oep disrupts mesoderm formation, a phenotype that is not
  produced by either mutation alone and is consistent with our model of an
  interdependence of Fgf8 and Nodal pathways through the genetic regulation of
  the Nodal co-factor Oep and the cell propagation of Nodal signalling.
  Moreover, mesodermal cell populations are affected differentially by double
  loss-of-function of Zoep;ace. Most of the dorsal mesoderm undergoes massive
  cell death by the end of gastrulation, in contrast to either single-mutant
  phenotype. However, some mesoderm cells are still able to undergo myogenic
  differentiation in the anterior trunk of Zoep;ace embryos, revealing a
  morphological transition at the level of somites 6-8. Further decreasing Oep
  levels by removing maternal oep products aggravates the mesodermal defects in
  double mutants by disrupting the fate of the entire mesoderm. Together, these
  results demonstrate synergy between oep and fgf8 that operates with regional
  differences and is involved in the induction, maintenance, movement and
  survival of mesodermal cell populations.}

  called the primary capillary plexus, which subsequently remodels, with the
  size of the vacancies between ribbons of endothelial cells coarsening over
  time. To isolate such intrinsic morphogenetic ability of endothelial cells
  from its regulation by long-range guidance cues and additional cell types, we
  use an in vitro model of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in
  Matrigel. This quasi-two-dimensional endothelial cell culture model would
  most closely correspond to vasculogenesis in flat areas of the embryo like
  the yolk sac. Several studies have used continuum mathematical models to
  explore in vitro vasculogenesis: such models describe cell ensembles but
  ignore the endothelial cells' shapes and active surface fluctuations. While
  these models initially reproduce vascular-like morphologies, they eventually
  stabilize into a disconnected pattern of vascular "islands." Also, they fail
  to reproduce temporally correct network coarsening. Using a cell-centered
  computational model, we show that the endothelial cells' elongated shape is
  key to correct spatiotemporal in silico replication of stable vascular
  network growth. We validate our simulation results against HUVEC cultures
  using time-resolved image analysis and find that our simulations
  quantitatively reproduce in vitro vasculogenesis and subsequent in vitro

  abstract = {During vertebrate gastrulation, the three germ layers, ectoderm,
  mesoderm and endoderm are formed, and the resulting progenitor cells are
  brought into the positions from which they will later contribute more complex
  tissues and organs. A core element in this process is the internalization of
  mesodermal and endodermal progenitors at the onset of gastrulation. Although
  many of the molecules that induce mesendoderm have been identified, much less
  is known about the cellular mechanisms underlying mesendodermal cell
  internalization and germ layer formation. Here we show that at the onset of
  zebrafish gastrulation, mesendodermal progenitors in dorsal/axial regions of
  the germ ring internalize by single cell delamination. Once internalized,
  mesendodermal progenitors upregulate E-Cadherin (Cadherin 1) expression,
  become increasingly motile and eventually migrate along the overlying
  epiblast (ectodermal) cell layer towards the animal pole of the gastrula.
  When E-Cadherin function is compromised, mesendodermal progenitors still
  internalize, but, with gastrulation proceeding, fail to elongate and
  efficiently migrate along the epiblast, whereas epiblast cells themselves
  exhibit reduced radial cell intercalation movements. This indicates that
  cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is needed within the forming shield for
  both epiblast cell intercalation, and mesendodermal progenitor cell
  elongation and migration during zebrafish gastrulation. Our data provide
  insight into the cellular mechanisms underlying mesendodermal progenitor cell
  internalization and subsequent migration during zebrafish gastrulation, and
  the role of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in these processes.}

  abstract = {The currently accepted interpretation of the clock and wavefront
  model of somitogenesis is that a posteriorly moving molecular gradient
  sequentially slows the rate of clock oscillations, resulting in a spatial
  readout of temporal oscillations. However, while molecular components of the
  clocks and wavefronts have now been identified in the pre-somitic mesoderm
  (PSM), there is not yet conclusive evidence demonstrating that the observed
  molecular wavefronts act to slow clock oscillations. Here we present an
  alternative formulation of the clock and wavefront model in which oscillator
  coupling, already known to play a key role in oscillator synchronisation,
  plays a fundamentally important role in the slowing of oscillations along the
  anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Our model has three parameters which can be
  determined, in any given species, by the measurement of three quantities: the
  clock period in the posterior PSM, somite length and the length of the PSM. A
  travelling wavefront, which slows oscillations along the AP axis, is an
  emergent feature of the model. Using the model we predict: (a) the distance
  between moving stripes of gene expression; (b) the number of moving stripes
  of gene expression and (c) the oscillator period profile along the AP axis.
  Predictions regarding the stripe data are verified using existing zebrafish
  data. We simulate a range of experimental perturbations and demonstrate how
  the model can be used to unambiguously define a reference frame along the AP
  axis. Comparing data from zebrafish, chick, mouse and snake, we demonstrate
  that: (a) variation in patterning profiles is accounted for by a single
  nondimensional parameter; the ratio of coupling strengths; and (b) the period
  profile along the AP axis is conserved across species. Thus the model is
  consistent with the idea that, although the genes involved in pattern
  propagation in the PSM vary, there is a conserved patterning mechanism across
  species.}

  control the organization of sheets of cells, we demonstrated the emergence of
  stable patterns of proliferative foci. Regions of concentrated growth
  corresponded to regions of high tractional stress generated within the sheet,

  measured directly by using a micromechanical force sensor array. Inhibiting
  actomyosin-based tension or cadherin-mediated connections between cells
  disrupted the spatial pattern of proliferation. These findings demonstrate
  the existence of patterns of mechanical forces that originate from the

  kilobase (kb) DNA restriction fragment containing a junction of viral and
  host sequences. Host sequences from this clone were used to retrieve 25 kb of

  normal mouse DNA. Hybridization with subcloned DNA fragments of MMTV int1
  detected abnormal restriction fragments in digests of DNA from 18 of 26 C3H
  mammary tumors. The rearrangements all appeared to be due to the insertion of
  an MMTV provirus, and the integration sites were located in at least five
  clusters over a total distance of 19 kb. A polyadenylated 2.6 kb RNA species

  abstract = {Directed cell migration is critical for tissue morphogenesis and
  wound healing, but the mechanism of directional control is poorly understood.
  Here we show that the direction in which cells extend their leading edge can
  be controlled by constraining cell shape using micrometer-sized extracellular
  matrix (ECM) islands. When cultured on square ECM islands in the presence of
  motility factors, cells preferentially extended lamellipodia, filopodia, and
  microspikes from their corners. Square cells reoriented their stress fibers
  and focal adhesions so that tractional forces were concentrated in these
  corner regions. When cell tension was dissipated, lamellipodia extension
  ceased. Mechanical interactions between cells and ECM that modulate
  cytoskeletal tension may therefore play a key role in the control of
  directional cell motility.}

  mechanisms driving epithelial morphogenesis. Still, many aspects of the
  relationship between local cleavage patterns and tissue-level properties
  remain poorly understood. Here we develop a topological model that simulates
  the dynamics of a 2D proliferating epithelium from generation to generation,
  enabling the exploration of a wide variety of biologically plausible cleavage
  patterns. We investigate a spectrum of models that incorporate the spatial
  impact of neighboring cells and the temporal influence of parent cells on the
  choice of cleavage plane. Our findings show that cleavage patterns generate
  "signature" equilibrium distributions of polygonal cell shapes. These
  signatures enable the inference of local cleavage parameters such as neighbor
  impact, maternal influence, and division symmetry from global observations of
  the distribution of cell shape. Applying these insights to the proliferating
  epithelia of five diverse organisms, we find that strong division symmetry
  and moderate neighbor/maternal influence are required to reproduce the
  predominance of hexagonal cells and low variability in cell shape seen
  empirically. Furthermore, we present two distinct cleavage pattern models,
  one stochastic and one deterministic, that can reproduce the empirical
  distribution of cell shapes. Although the proliferating epithelia of the five
  diverse organisms show a highly conserved cell shape distribution, there are
  multiple plausible cleavage patterns that can generate this distribution, and
  experimental evidence suggests that indeed plants and fruitflies use distinct
  division mechanisms.}

  cytoplasm of cells after the first cleavages, being found in some nuclei
  after the seventh or eighth cleavage, whereas all nuclei from the 1,000-cell

  well-established GRN model into a predictive, dynamic Boolean computational
  model. This Boolean model computes spatial and temporal gene expression
  according to the regulatory logic and gene interactions specified in a GRN
  model for embryonic development in the sea urchin. Additional information
  input into the model included the progressive embryonic geometry and gene
  expression kinetics. The resulting model predicted gene expression patterns
  for a large number of individual regulatory genes each hour up to
  gastrulation (30 h) in four different spatial domains of the embryo. Direct
  comparison with experimental observations showed that the model predictively
  computed these patterns with remarkable spatial and temporal accuracy. In
  addition, we used this model to carry out in silico perturbations of
  regulatory functions and of embryonic spatial organization. The model
  computationally reproduced the altered developmental functions observed
  experimentally. Two major conclusions are that the starting GRN model

  widely analysed by numerical simulations of invagination in sea urchins and

  in vivo. Here we develop a simulation of multicellular embryo invagination
  that allows access to both cellular and multicellular mechanical behaviours
  of the embryo. In this model, the tissue is composed of adhesive individual
  cells, in which shape change dynamics is governed by internal acto-myosin
  forces and the hydrodynamic flow associated with membrane movements. We
  investigated the minimal structural and force elements sufficient to
  phenocopy mesoderm invagination. The minimal structures are cell membranes
  characterized by an acto-myosin cortical tension and connected by apical and
  basal junctions and an acto-myosin contractile ring connected to the apical
  junctions. An increase in the apical-cortical surface tension is the only
  control parameter change required to phenocopy most known multicellular and
  cellular shape changes of Drosophila gastrulation. Specifically, behaviours
  observed in vivo, including apical junction movements at the onset of
  gastrulation, cell elongation and subsequent shortening during invagination,
  and the development of a dorso-ventral gradient of thickness of the embryo,
  are predicted by this model as passive mechanical consequences of the
  genetically controlled increase in the apical surface tension in invaginating
  mesoderm cells, thus demonstrating the accurate description of structures at
  both global and single cell scales.}

  cell division and apoptosis. The multicellular dynamics of such systems is
  influenced by mechanical conditions and can give rise to cell rearrangements
  and movements. We develop a continuum description of tissue dynamics, which
  describes the stress distribution and the cell flow field on large scales. In
  the absence of division and apoptosis, we consider the tissue to behave as an
  elastic solid. Cell division and apoptosis introduce stress sources that, in
  general, are anisotropic. By combining cell number balance with dynamic
  equations for the stress source, we show that the tissue effectively behaves
  as a viscoelastic fluid with a relaxation time set by the rates of division
  and apoptosis. If the system is confined in a fixed volume, it reaches a
  homeostatic state in which division and apoptosis balance. In this state,
  cells undergo a diffusive random motion driven by the stochasticity of
  division and apoptosis. We calculate the expression for the effective
  diffusion coefficient as a function of the tissue parameters and compare our

  abstract = {The fact that some organisms are able to regenerate organs of the
  correct shape and size following amputation is particularly fascinating, but
  the mechanism by which this occurs remains poorly understood. The zebrafish
  (Danio rerio) caudal fin has emerged as a model system for the study of bone
  development and regeneration. The fin comprises 16 to 18 bony rays, each
  containing multiple joints along its proximodistal axis that give rise to
  segments. Experimental observations on fin ray growth, regeneration and joint
  formation have been described, but no unified theory has yet been put forward
  to explain how growth and joint patterns are controlled. We present a model
  for the control of fin ray growth during development and regeneration,
  integrated with a model for joint pattern formation, which is in agreement
  with published, as well as new, experimental data. We propose that fin ray
  growth and joint patterning are coordinated through the interaction of three
  morphogens. When the model is extended to incorporate multiple rays across
  the fin, it also accounts for how the caudal fin acquires its shape during
  development, and regains its correct size and shape following amputation.}

  repository for growth factors is highlighted along with more recent studies
  implicating the 3-dimensional organization and physical properties of the ECM

  different statistical properties of the cells at the tissue level. We focus
  on isotropic growth and division rules suggested for plant cells, and compare
  the models with data from the Arabidopsis shoot. We find that several
  division rules can lead to the correct distribution of number of neighbors,
  as seen in recent studies. In addition we find that when also geometrical
  properties are taken into account other constraints on the cell division
  rules result. We find that division rules acting in favor of equally sized
  and symmetrically shaped daughter cells can best describe the statistical
  tissue properties.}

  introduced, primarily to compute the dynamics of large numbers of
  three-dimensional deformable cells in multicellular systems. Within this
  model framework, each cell is represented by a collection of elastically
  coupled elements, interacting with one another via short-range potentials,
  and dynamically updated using over-damped Langevin dynamics. The SEM can also
  be used to represent a single cell in more detail, by using a larger number
  of subcellular elements exclusively identified with that cell. We have tested
  whether, in this context, the SEM yields viscoelastic properties consistent
  with those measured on single living cells. Employing virtual methods of bulk
  rheology and microrheology we find that the SEM successfully captures many
  cellular rheological properties at intermediate time scales and moderate
  strains, including weak power law rheology. In its simplest guise, the SEM
  cannot describe long-time/large-strain cell responses. Capturing these
  cellular properties requires extensions of the SEM which incorporate active
  cytoskeletal rearrangement. Such extensions will be the subject of a future

  abstract = {Primitive streak formation in the chick embryo involves
  significant coordinated cell movement lateral to the streak, in addition to
  the posterior-anterior movement of cells in the streak proper. Cells lateral
  to the streak are observed to undergo 'polonaise movements', i.e. two large
  counter-rotating vortices, reminiscent of eddies in a fluid. In this paper,
  we propose a mechanism for these movement patterns which relies on
  chemotactic signals emitted by a dipolar configuration of cells in the
  posterior region of the epiblast. The 'chemotactic dipole' consists of
  adjacent regions of cells emitting chemo-attractants and chemo-repellents. We
  motivate this idea using a mathematical analogy between chemotaxis and
  electrostatics, and test this idea using large-scale computer simulations. We
  implement active cell response to both neighboring mechanical interactions
  and chemotactic gradients using the Subcellular Element Model. Simulations
  show the emergence of large-scale vortices of cell movement. The length and
  time scales of vortex formation are in reasonable agreement with experimental
  data. We also provide quantitative estimates for the robustness of the
  chemotaxis dipole mechanism, which indicate that the mechanism has an error
  tolerance of about 10% to variation in chemotactic parameters, assuming that
  only 1% of the cell population is involved in emitting signals. This
  tolerance increases for larger populations of cells emitting signals.}

  modeling of these phenomena requires algorithms that can capture active cell

  on extensions of the subcellular element model to model active biomechanical
  subcellular processes. These processes lead to emergent cell and tissue level
  phenotypes at larger scales, including (i) adaptive shape deformations in

  abstract = {In zebrafish (Danio rerio), meroblastic cleavages generate an
  embryo in which blastomeres cover the animal pole of a large yolk cell. At
  the 500-1000 cell stage, the marginal blastomeres fuse with the yolk cell
  forming the yolk syncytial layer. During epiboly the blastoderm and the yolk
  syncytial layer spread toward the vegetal pole. We have studied developmental
  changes in organization and function during epiboly of two distinct
  microtubule arrays located in the cortical cytoplasm of the yolk cell. In the
  anuclear yolk cytoplasmic layer, an array of microtubules extends along the
  animal-vegetal axis to the vegetal pole. In the early blastula the yolk
  cytoplasmic layer microtubules appear to originate from the marginal
  blastomeres. Once formed, the yolk syncytial layer exhibits its own network
  of intercrossing mitotic or interphase microtubules. The microtubules of the
  yolk cytoplasmic layer emanate from the microtubule network of the syncytial
  layer. At the onset of epiboly, the external yolk syncytial layer narrows,
  the syncytial nuclei become tightly packed and the network of intercrossing
  microtubules surrounding them becomes denser. Soon after, there is a vegetal
  expansion of the blastoderm and of the yolk syncytial layer with its network
  of intercrossing microtubules. Concomitantly, the yolk cytoplasmic layer
  diminishes and its set of animal-vegetal microtubules becomes shorter. We
  investigated the involvement of microtubules in epiboly using the microtubule
  depolymerizing agent nocodazole and a stabilizing agent taxol. In embryos
  treated with nocodazole, microtubules were absent and epibolic movements of
  the yolk syncytial nuclei were blocked. In contrast, the vegetal expansion of
  the enveloping layer and deep cells was only partially inhibited. The process
  of endocytosis, proposed to play a major role in epiboly of the yolk
  syncytial layer (Betchaku, T. and Trinkaus, J. P. (1986) Am. Zool. 26,
  193-199), was still observed in nocodazole-treated embryos. Treatment of
  embryos with taxol led to a delay in all epibolic movements. We propose that
  the yolk cell microtubules contribute either directly or indirectly to all
  epibolic movements. However, the epibolic movements of the yolk syncytial
  layer nuclei and of the blastoderm are not coupled, and only movements of the
  yolk syncytial nuclei are absolutely dependent on microtubules. We
  hypothesize that the microtubule network of the syncytial layer and the
  animal-vegetal set of the yolk cytoplasmic layer contribute differently to
  various aspects of epiboly. Models that address the mechanisms by which the
  two microtubule arrays might function during epiboly are discussed.}

  to consider the objects boundaries in one image as semi-permeable membranes
  and to let the other image, considered as a deformable grid model, diffuse
  through these interfaces, by the action of effectors situated within the
  membranes. We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell's demons. We
  show that this concept relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction,
  with an intermediate step being optical flow techniques. We use the concept
  of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms,
  one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only
  contour points, and a last one operating on already segmented images.
  Finally, we present results with synthesized deformations and real medical
  images, with applications to heart motion tracking and three-dimensional
  inter-patients matching.}

  abstract = {Cell movements in Fundulus blastoderms during gastrulation were
  studied utilizing time-lapse cinemicrography and electron microscopy.
  Time-lapse films reveal that cells of the enveloping layer undulate and
  sometimes separate briefly but remain together in a cohesive layer. During
  epiboly, the marginal enveloping layer cells move over the periblast as it
  expands over the yolk sphere. Movement occurs as a result of ruffled membrane
  activity of the free borders of the marginal cells. Deep blastomeres become
  increasingly active during blastula and gastrula stages. Lobopodia project
  from the blastomeres in blastulae and adhere to other cells in gastrulae,
  giving the cells traction for movement. Contact specializations are formed by
  the lateral adjacent plasma membranes of enveloping layer cells. An apical
  junction is characterized by an intercellular gap of 60-75 A. Below this
  contact, the plasma membranes are separated by 120 A or more. In
  mid-gastrulae, cytoplasmic fibrils occur adjacent to some apical junctions,
  and small desmosomes appear below the apical junction. Septate desmosomes
  also appear at this time. A junction with an intercellular gap of 60 A occurs
  between marginal enveloping layer cells and periblast. Contacts between deep
  blastomeres become numerous in gastrulae and consist of contacts at the
  crests of surface undulations, short areas of contact in which the plasma
  membranes are 60 or 120 A apart, and long regions characterized by a 200-A
  intercellular gap. Lobopodia contact other blastomeres only in gastrulae.
  These junctions contain a 200-A intercellular space. Some deep blastomeres
  are in contact with the tips of periblast microvilli. The mechanism of
  epiboly in Fundulus is discussed and reevaluated in terms of these
  observations. The enveloping layer is adherent to the margin of the periblast
  and moves over it as a coherent cellular sheet. Periblast epiboly involves a
  controlled flow of cytoplasm from the thicker periblast into the thinner yolk
  cytoplasmic layer with which it is continuous. Deep cells move by adhering to
  each other, to the inner surface of the enveloping layer, and to the
  periblast.}

  move rapidly, at about 10--15 μm/min, regardless of whether they move by
  blebbing or spreading. Evidence suggests that this high speed is associated
  with weak adhesion of the trailing edge: it remains rounded, without large
  retraction fibers, and it advances continuously with advance of the leading
  edge, not sporadically, as it would if it adhered strongly. (2) In contrast,
  when stationary cells in close contact separate, they remain connected at
  first by large retraction fibers, suggesting strong punctate adhesions. (3)
  Fundulus deep cells appear to move in two ways: a) protrusion of blebs,
  followed by much cytoplasmic flow; b) spreading of lamellipodia, preceded by
  filopodia and frequent cell shortening. Locomotion by shortening of a long
  lobopodium is really a form of spreading movement, since the tip of a
  lobopodium always spreads. (4) Filopodia were not found except at the leading
  edge of a spreading lamellipodium and often spread themselves; perhaps
  filopodia and lamellipodia are interconvertible. (5) A lamellipodial margin
  may form undulations in vivo that move backward like ruffles in vitro. (6) At
  all times, whether stationary or moving, the surface of any given deep cell
  is smooth, raising unanswered questions concerning the source of surface for
  their rapid protrusive activity.}

  early gastrulation of Fundulus heteroclitus, prior to and during germ ring
  formation. This conclusion has been reached by following the motile behavior
  of large numbers of individual cells. Instead of involution, superficial deep
  cells of the marginal region of the blastoderm undergo ingression. They do
  not leave the surface as members of a flowing cohesive sheet, but sink
  beneath rather haphazardly as individuals. Indeed, during much of ingression,
  many marginal cells are so loosely arranged that they move about freely on
  the yolk syncytial layer. A small proportion of the cells initially at the
  blastoderm margin undergo ingression there, but most recede from the margin
  and ingress supramarginally one to three cell diameters from the margin.
  Cells that are initially supramarginal ingress mainly there, sometimes quite
  far from the margin. Only a small number moves to the margin and ingresses
  there. Interestingly, although most ingression takes place supramarginally,
  much occurs close to the margin-up to one to four cells away. Ingression
  begins immediately after the onset of epiboly and is most active before
  appearance of the germ ring; it ceases quite soon thereafter. It is also more
  active dorsally than ventrally, correlating with the earlier formation of the
  germ ring dorsally. Ingression constitutes the first invasive cellular
  activity of development. Significantly, it proceeds by blebbing locomotion, a
  noncontact inhibiting mode of cell movement. The possible broader import of
  these discoveries is given appropriate attention.}

  Wnt11 exerts its effects remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Wnt11
  functions during zebrafish gastrulation by regulating the cohesion of
  mesodermal and endodermal (mesendodermal) progenitor cells. Importantly, we
  demonstrate that Wnt11 activity in this process is mediated by the GTPase
  Rab5, a key regulator of early endocytosis, as blocking Rab5c activity in
  wild-type embryos phenocopies slb/wnt11 mutants, and enhancing Rab5c activity
  in slb/wnt11 mutant embryos rescues the mutant phenotype. In addition, we
  find that Wnt11 and Rab5c control the endocytosis of E-cadherin and are
  required in mesendodermal cells for E-cadherin-mediated cell cohesion.
  Together, our results suggest that Wnt11 controls tissue morphogenesis by
  modulating E-cadherin-mediated cell cohesion through Rab5c, a novel mechanism
  of Wnt signaling in gastrulation.}

  collective cell migration patterns through cell-cell interactions. Using
  microfabrication techniques to allow epithelial cell sheets to migrate into
  strips whose width was varied from one up to several cell diameters, we
  identified the modes of collective migration in response to geometrical
  constraints. We observed that a decrease in the width of the strips is
  accompanied by an overall increase in the speed of the migrating cell sheet.
  Moreover, large-scale vortices over tens of cell lengths appeared in the wide
  strips whereas a contraction-elongation type of motion is observed in the
  narrow strips. Velocity fields and traction force signatures within the
  cellular population revealed migration modes with alternative pulling and/or
  pushing mechanisms that depend on extrinsic constraints. Force transmission
  through intercellular contacts plays a key role in this process because the
  disruption of cell-cell junctions abolishes directed collective migration and
  passive cell-cell adhesions tend to move the cells uniformly together
  independent of the geometry. Altogether, these findings not only demonstrate
  the existence of patterns of collective cell migration depending on external
  constraints but also provide a mechanical explanation for how large-scale

  intercalations during epiboly mix cells located deeply in the blastoderm
  among more superficial ones. These rearrangements thoroughly stir the
  positions of deep cells, as the blastoderm thins and spreads across the yolk
  cell. (2) Involution at or near the blastoderm margin occurs during
  gastrulation. This movement folds the blastoderm into two cellular layers,
  the epiblast and hypoblast, within a ring (the germ ring) around its entire
  circumference. Involuting cells move anteriorwards in the hypoblast relative
  to cells that remain in the epiblast; the movement shears the positions of
  cells that were neighbors before gastrulation. Involuting cells eventually
  form endoderm and mesoderm, in an anterior-posterior sequence according to
  the time of involution. The epiblast is equivalent to embryonic ectoderm. (3)
  Mediolateral cell intercalations in both the epiblast and hypoblast mediate
  convergence and extension movements towards the dorsal side of the gastrula.
  By this rearrangement, cells that were initially neighboring one another
  become dispersed along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Epiboly,
  involution and convergent extension in zebrafish involve the same kinds of
  cellular rearrangements as in amphibians, and they occur during comparable

  the outer layer, the epiblast. In this study, we examine the origin of the
  zebrafish endoderm and its separation from the mesoderm. By labeling
  individual cells located at the margin of the blastula, we demonstrate that
  all structures that are endodermal in origin are derived predominantly from
  the more dorsal and lateral cells of the blastoderm margin. Frequently
  marginal cells give rise to both endodermal and mesodermal derivatives,
  demonstrating that these two lineages have not yet separated. Cells located
  farther than 4 cell diameters from the margin give rise exclusively to
  mesoderm, and not to endoderm. Following involution, we see a variety of
  cellular changes indicating the differentiation of the two germ layers.
  Endodermal cells gradually flatten and extend filopodial processes forming a
  noncontiguous inner layer of cells against the yolk. At this time, they also
  begin to express Forkhead-domain 2 protein. Mesodermal cells form a coherent
  layer of round cells separating the endoderm and ectoderm. In cyclops-mutant
  embryos that have reduced mesodermal anlage, we demonstrate that by late
  gastrulation not only mesodermal but also endodermal cells are fewer in

  blastodermal cells was traced for the first time in ovo from prestreak stages
  XI-XII through HH stage 3, when the primitive streak is initially established

  the stage 3 primitive streak were mapped predominantly to a specific region
  where the embryonic midline crosses the posterior margin of the epiblast. No
  significant contribution to the early primitive streak was seen from the
  anterolateral epiblast. Instead, the precursor cells generated daughter cells

  anteroposterior embryonic axis. The resulting daughter cell population was
  arranged in a longitudinal array extending the complete length of the

  of most organisms. It can involve either the migration of closely packed

  more stable cell-cell interactions and less frequent changes in neighbours.
  These collective movements can be controlled by short- or long-range dynamic
  gradients of extracellular signalling molecules, depending on the number of
  cells involved and their distance of migration. These gradients are sensed by
  some or all of the migrating cells and translated into directed migration,
  which in many settings is further modulated by cell-contact-mediated
  attractive or repulsive interactions that result in contact-following or
  contact-inhibition of locomotion, respectively. Studies of collective
  migration of groups of epithelial cells during development indicate that, in
  some cases, only leader cells sense and migrate up an external signal
  gradient, and that adjacent cells follow through strong cell-cell contacts.
  In this Commentary, I review studies of collective cell migration of
  differently sized cell populations during the development of several model
  organisms, and discuss our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms

  abstract = {Many morphogenetic processes are accomplished by coordinated cell
  rearrangements. These rearrangements are accompanied by substantial shifts in
  the neighbor relationships between cells. Here we propose a model for
  studying morphogenesis in epithelial sheets by directed cell neighbor change.
  Our model describes cell rearrangements by accounting for the balance of
  forces between neighboring cells within an epithelium. Cell rearrangement and
  cell shape changes occur when these forces are not in mechanical equilibrium.
  We will show that cell rearrangement within the epidermal enveloping layer
  (EVL) of the teleost fish Fundulus during epiboly can be explained solely in
  terms of the balance of forces generated among constituent epithelial cells.
  Within a cell, we account for circumferential elastic forces and the force
  generated by hydrostatic and osmotic pressure. The model treats epithelial
  cells as two-dimensional polygons where the mechanical forces are applied to
  the polygonal nodes. A cell node protrudes or contracts when the nodal forces
  are not in mechanical equilibrium. In an epithelial sheet, adjacent cells
  share common boundary nodes; in this way, mechanical force is transmitted
  from cell to cell, mimicking junctional coupling. These junctional nodes can
  slide, and nodes may appear or disappear, so that the number of polygonal
  sides is variable. Computer graphics allows us to compare numerical
  simulations of the model with time-lapse cinemicroscopy of cell
  rearrangements in the living embryo, and data obtained from fixed and silver
  stained embryos. By manipulating the mechanical properties of the model cells
  we can study the conditions necessary to reproduce normal cell behavior
  during Fundulus epiboly. We find that simple stress relaxation is sufficient
  to account for cell rearrangements among interior cells of the EVL when they
  are isotropically contractile. Experimental observations show that the number
  of EVL marginal cells continuously decreases throughout epiboly. In order for
  the simulation to reproduce this behavior, cells at the EVL boundary must
  generate protrusive forces rather than contractile tension forces. Therefore,
  the simulation results suggest that the mechanical properties of EVL marginal
  cells at their leading edge must be quite different from EVL interior cells.}

  movements. It is possible that a few rules governing cell behavior could
  orchestrate the shaping of the entire tissue. We test this hypothesis by
  constructing a computer model of the tissue to investigate how rules
  governing cell motility and cell-cell interactions can account for the major
  features of notochord morphogenesis. These rules are drawn from the
  literature on in vitro cell studies and experimental observations of
  notochord cell behavior. The following types of motility rules are
  investigated: (1) refractory tissue boundaries that inhibit cell motility,
  (2) statistical persistence of motion, (3) contact inhibition of protrusion
  between cells, and (4) polarized and nonpolarized protrusive activity. We
  show that only the combination of refractory boundaries, contact inhibition
  and polarized protrusive activity reproduces normal notochord development.
  Guided by these rules, cells spontaneously align into a parallel array of
  elongating cells. Self alignment optimizes the geometric conditions for
  polarized protrusive activity by progressively minimizing contact inhibition
  between cells. Cell polarization, initiated at refractory tissue boundaries,
  spreads along successive cell rows into the tissue interior as cells restrict

  abstract = {Positional information has been suggested to play a central role
  in pattern formation during development. The strong version of positional
  information states that there is a cell parameter, positional value, which is
  related to position as in a coordinate system and which determines cell
  differentiation. A weaker version merely emphasises position as a key
  determinant in cell development and differentiation. There is evidence for
  boundaries and orthogonal axes playing an important role in positional
  systems. A positional signal is distinguished from an inductive interaction
  because the former specifies multiple states, confers polarity, and can act
  over a long range. A gradient in a diffusible morphogen is just one way of
  specifying position. There is now good evidence in several systems for
  substances which may be the morphogen for positional signalling. The product
  of the bicoid gene in early Drosophila development is the best prospect.
  Retinoic acid is unique in its ability to alter positional value and may also
  be a morphogen. The best evidence for positional value, a concept fundamental
  to positional information, remains a biological assay based on grafting. The
  idea of positional value uncouples differentiation and position, and allows
  considerable freedom for patterning. It is not clear whether positional value
  or differentiation involves a combinatorial mechanism. Interpretation of
  positional information remains a central problem. There is good evidence that
  cells can respond differentially to less than a two-fold change in
  concentration of a chemical signal. It may be that interpretation involves
  listing the sites at which a particular class of cell differentiation will
  occur. The problem is made less severe when blocks of cells are specified
  together as in mechanisms based on an isomorphic prepattern. Isomorphic
  prepatterns could establish repeated structures which are equivalent and
  which are then made non-equivalent by positional information. This would
  enable local differences to develop. The combination of these two mechanisms
  may be wide-spread. There is evidence that positional signals within a single
  animal and in related animals are conserved. It is not clear just how wide
  this conservation is, but it is at phylotypic stages, rather than in eggs,

  the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) of zebrafish embryos, revealed the generation
  of stochastic patterns of fast, short-range, and slow, long-range Ca(2+)
  waves that propagate exclusively through the external YSL (E-YSL). Starting
  abruptly just after doming (~4.5h post-fertilization: hpf), and ending at the
  shield stage (~6.0hpf) these distinct classes of waves propagated at mean
  velocities of ~50 and ~4μm/s, respectively. Although the number and pattern
  of these waves varied between embryos, their initiation site and arcs of
  propagation displayed a distinct dorsal bias, suggesting an association with
  the formation and maintenance of the nascent dorsal-ventral axis. Wave
  initiation coincided with a characteristic clustering of YSL nuclei (YSN),
  and their associated perinuclear ER, in the E-YSL. Furthermore, the inter-YSN
  distance (IND) appeared to be critical such that Ca(2+) wave propagation
  occurred only when this was <~8μm; an IND >~8μm was coincidental with wave
  termination at shield stage. Treatment with the IP(3)R antagonist, 2-APB, the
  Ca(2+) buffer, 5,5'-dibromo BAPTA, and the SERCA-pump inhibitor,
  thapsigargin, resulted in a significant disruption of the E-YSL Ca(2+) waves,
  whereas exposure to the RyR antagonists, ryanodine and dantrolene, had no
  significant effect. These findings led us to propose that the E-YSL Ca(2+)
  waves are generated mainly via Ca(2+) release from IP(3)Rs located in the
  perinuclear ER, and that the clustering of the YSN is an essential step in
  providing a CICR pathway required for wave propagation. This article is part

  abstract = {As the zebrafish embryo undergoes gastrulation and epiboly, the
  cells of the enveloping layer (EVL) expand, covering the entire yolk cell.
  During the epiboly process, the EVL cells move as a coherent layer, remaining
  tightly attached to each other and to the underlying yolk syncytial layer
  (YSL). In view of the central role of the actin cytoskeleton, in both cell
  motility and cell-cell adhesion, we have labeled these cells in situ with
  fluorescent phalloidin and anti-actin antibodies. We show that, throughout
  their migration, the EVL cells retain a conspicuous cortical actin
  cytoskeletal belt coinciding with cell surface cadherins. At the margins
  approaching the YSL, the EVL cells extend, from their apicolateral domains,
  actin-rich filopodial protrusions devoid of detectable cadherin. We have
  studied the role of the actin cytoskeleton in the maintenance of EVL cohesion
  during epiboly. Cytochalasin treatment of embryos induces EVL dissociation
  accompanied by general detachment of the rest of the embryonic cells. In the
  dissociating EVL cells, the cortical actin belt undergoes fragmentation with
  the formation of actin aggregates; cadherins, on the other hand, remain
  evenly distributed at the junctional cell surface. Removal of Ca2+ by
  ethyleneglycolbis (amino-ethyl-ether)-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) treatment also
  induces cell dissociation without visible disruption of the cortical actin
  belt. The protein kinase inhibitor
  (1-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine dihydrochloride (H-7), which
  blocks acto-myosin contractility and disrupts actin cables in cultured cells,
  also potentiates cytochalasin-induced dissociation and promotes the
  projection of numerous actin-rich lamellipodial extensions. The fact that EVL
  cells produce microspike-like structures towards the YSL and are capable of
  lamellipodial activity lend further support to the suggestion (R.W. Keller
  and J.P. Trinkaus. 1987. Dev. Biol. 120: 12-24) that the EVL cells are not
  passively mobilized on the expanding YSL but actively participate in
  epiboly.}

  respect to a reference frame--in 1632. He noted that a person below deck
  would be unable to discern whether the boat was moving. Embryologists, while
  recognizing that embryonic tissues undergo large-scale deformations, have
  failed to account for relative motion when analyzing cell motility data. A
  century of scientific articles has advanced the concept that embryonic cells
  move ("migrate") in an autonomous fashion such that, as time progresses, the
  cells and their progeny assemble an embryo. In sharp contrast, the motion of
  the surrounding extracellular matrix scaffold has been largely
  ignored/overlooked. We developed computational/optical methods that measure
  the extent embryonic cells move relative to the extracellular matrix. Our
  time-lapse data show that epiblastic cells largely move in concert with a
  sub-epiblastic extracellular matrix during stages 2 and 3 in primitive streak
  quail embryos. In other words, there is little cellular motion relative to
  the extracellular matrix scaffold--both components move together as a tissue.
  The extracellular matrix displacements exhibit bilateral vortical motion,
  convergence to the midline, and extension along the presumptive vertebral
  axis--all patterns previously attributed solely to cellular "migration." Our
  time-resolved data pose new challenges for understanding how extracellular
  chemical (morphogen) gradients, widely hypothesized to guide cellular
  trajectories at early gastrulation stages, are maintained in this dynamic
  extracellular environment. We conclude that models describing primitive
  streak cellular guidance mechanisms must be able to account for
  sub-epiblastic extracellular matrix displacements.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The luminal surface of the gut is lined with a
  monolayer of epithelial cells that acts as a nutrient absorptive engine and
  protective barrier. To maintain its integrity and functionality, the
  epithelium is renewed every few days. Theoretical models are powerful tools
  that can be used to test hypotheses concerning the regulation of this renewal
  process, to investigate how its dysfunction can lead to loss of homeostasis
  and neoplasia, and to identify potential therapeutic interventions. Here we
  propose a new multiscale model for crypt dynamics that links phenomena
  occurring at the subcellular, cellular and tissue levels of organisation.
  METHODS: At the subcellular level, deterministic models characterise
  molecular networks, such as cell-cycle control and Wnt signalling. The output
  of these models determines the behaviour of each epithelial cell in response
  to intra-, inter- and extracellular cues. The modular nature of the model
  enables us to easily modify individual assumptions and analyse their effects
  on the system as a whole. RESULTS: We perform virtual microdissection and
  labelling-index experiments, evaluate the impact of various model extensions,
  obtain new insight into clonal expansion in the crypt, and compare our
  predictions with recent mitochondrial DNA mutation data. CONCLUSIONS: We
  demonstrate that relaxing the assumption that stem-cell positions are fixed
  enables clonal expansion and niche succession to occur. We also predict that
  the presence of extracellular factors near the base of the crypt alone
  suffices to explain the observed spatial variation in nuclear beta-catenin
  levels along the crypt axis.}

  We highlight a few key factors, including environmental temperature, embryo
  size and environmental chemistry that might perturb the mechanics of
  morphogenesis in natural populations. Then we discuss several ways in which
  mechanics-including feedback from mechanical cues-might influence
  intra-specific variation in morphogenesis. To understand morphogenesis it
  will be necessary to consider whole-organism, environment and evolutionary
  scales because these larger scales present the challenges that developmental
  mechanisms have evolved to cope with. Studying the variation organisms
