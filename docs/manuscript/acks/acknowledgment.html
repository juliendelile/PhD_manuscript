<p>
	First of all, my gratitude goes to my PhD supervisors, <i>Nadine Peyri&eacute;ras</i> and <i>Ren&eacute; Doursat</i>, who shaped my vision of what being a researcher requires and means. Their association was complementary, Nadine communicating the flame and energy necessary to undertake this vast project, and Ren&eacute; bringing his crystal-clear precision to formalize the model; Nadine opening her lab and advising me on the biological concepts and challenges, and Ren√© overseeing their abstraction into equations and agent-based simulations. I am especially grateful to both of them for the precious help that they provided in the final months of the project, leading to the fulfillment of the present manuscript and concluding these four years of work.
</p>

<p>
	I am very grateful to <i>Liliana Solnica-Krezel</i>, <i>Sophie Vriz</i>, <i>Dirk Drasdo</i>, <i>Ed Munro</i>, <i>Lance Davidson</i> and <i>Roeland Merks</i> to honor my defence jury with their presence, and particularly to <i>Lance Davidson</i> and <i>Roeland Merks</i> for accepting to review the manuscript and provide insightful comments, despite a somewhat stretched out delivery on my part.
</p>

<p>
	I also want to thank my PhD tutor <i>St&eacute;phane Doncieux</i> for his wise pieces of advice, particularly concerning parameter space exploration strategies, and to <i>Pierre Collet</i> for his collaboration to this project and for allowing the simulation of thousands of virtual zebrafish embryos in the <i>j4 room</i> of the university of Strasbourg.
</p>

<p>
	Naturally, this project could not have come into existence without the Bourse de Docteur Ing&eacute;nieur (BDI) scholarship, provided by the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the General Directorate for Armament (DGA). I also wanted to thank my PhD program, Frontiers in Life Sciences, under the direction of <i>Fran&ccedil;ois Taddei</i> and <i>Samuel Bottani</i>, for providing such a inspiring environment, ideal for the realization of innovative projects.

<p>
	Creativity and interdisciplinarity are two key words describing the place where I have been fortunate to spend most of these four years in the center of Paris, i.e. the Complex Systems Institute, Paris &Icirc;le-de-France (ISC-PIF). I am very thankful to its founding director, <i>Paul Bourgine</i>, whose visionary and inexhaustible initiatives are the <i>cornucopia</i> from which so many interdisciplinary <q>complex systems</q> projects were born, including this unique environment. I am also thankful to his successors, <i>Ren&eacute; Doursat</i>, <i>Arnaud Banos</i> and <i>David Chavalarias</i>, for pursuing the legacy and developing new opportunities of intellectual exchanges. The <q>ISC</q> has hosted and continues to host great personalities whose continuous interactions with me have greatly contributed to both the scientific content of this PhD thesis and the daily enjoyment of these four years. I may cite <i>Daniel</i>, <i>Romain</i>, <i>Pierre</i>, <i>Mathieu</i>, <i>Matthieu</i>, <i>Mathieu</i>, <i>Tam Kien</i>, <i>Barbara</i>, <i>Thierry</i>, <i>Emmanuel</i>, <i>Camilo</i>, <i>Beno&icirc;t</i>, <i>Rapha&euml;l</i>, <i>Carlos</i>, <i>Elisa</i>, <i>Marlene</i>, <i>Genevi&egrave;ve</i>, <i>St&eacute;phanie</i>, <i>Jean-Philippe</i>, <i>Ricardo</i>, <i>Bivas</i>, <i>Taras</i>, <i>Alberto</i>, <i>Davide</i>, <i>Julie</i>, <i>Julie</i>, <i>Julian</i>, <i>Elias</i> and many others (some of them may be found at <a href="http://iscpif.fr/researchers">http://iscpif.fr/researchers</a>). I know this rough list does not transcribe the diversity and the quality of the exchanges we had but a few personalized words would not do them justice anyway.
</p>

<p>
	In parallel, the members of the <a href="http://www.inaf.cnrs-gif.fr/ned/accueil.html">Neurobiology and Development lab</a> in Gif-sur-Yvette, under the direction of <i>Philippe Vernier</i>, have guided the first and last efforts to build this project, from the early fibronectin cloning attempts to the final manuscript redaction. Many thanks to <i>Gaelle</i>, <i>Adeline</i>, <i>Louise</i>, <i>Paul</i>, <i>Dimitri</i>, <i>Ludovic</i>, the Colin sisters <i>Ingrid</i> and <i>Audrey</i>, <i>Monique</i>, <i>Sophie</i>, <i>Beno&icirc;t</i>, <i>Odile</i>, and the mysterious madeleine donor, for their pleasing company and support.
</p>

<p>
	Last but not least, my warm thoughts go to my friends from Bordeaux, Nancy and Paris, and my family. I want to apologize for having neglected them so often during those four years and I promise to make up for the lost time in the near future. Finally, thanks to <i>Maria</i>... for sharing your time with me.
