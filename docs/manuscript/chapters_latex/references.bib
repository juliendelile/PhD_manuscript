  abstract = {Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling generates subcellular
  asymmetry along an axis orthogonal to the epithelial apical-basal axis.
  Through a poorly understood mechanism, cell clones that have mutations in
  some PCP signaling components, including some, but not all, alleles of the
  receptor frizzled, cause polarity disruptions of neighboring wild-type cells,
  a phenomenon referred to as domineering nonautonomy. Here, a
  contact-dependent signaling hypothesis, derived from experimental results, is
  shown by reaction-diffusion, partial differential equation modeling and
  simulation to fully reproduce PCP phenotypes, including domineering
  nonautonomy, in the Drosophila wing. The sufficiency of this model and the
  experimental validation of model predictions reveal how specific
  protein-protein interactions produce autonomy or domineering nonautonomy.}

  morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) that inhibit E-cadherin protein (Cdh1)
  expression were injected into embryos. Cdh1 knockdown reduced embryo
  survival. In early cdh1 MO-injected embryos, the cleavage plane orientation
  between blastomeres was irregular and adhesion defects prevented normal
  compaction. Cdh1 knockdown inhibited epiboly cell movements. Epiboly delay
  caused yolk cell lysis and produced embryos with a bifurcated embryonic axis.
  Cdh1 knockdown inhibited gastrulation cell movements, causing defects in
  convergence and extension. Additionally, prechordal plate derivatives were
  absent in Cdh1 knockdown embryos even though presumptive prechordal plate
  markers were induced normally. E-cadherin mRNA coinjection demonstrated the

  signalling controls somite boundary position and regulates segmentation clock
  control of spatiotemporal Hox gene activation. Cell 106, 219-232). Dynamic
  expression of FGF8 in the presomitic mesoderm constitutes the wavefront of
  determination which sweeps along the body axis interacting as it moves with
  the segmentation clock to gate cells into somites. We also show that the
  model can mimic the anomalies formed when progression of the wavefront is
  disturbed and make some experimental predictions that can be used to test the

  cell-autonomous requirement for oep in Nodal signaling enabled us to test
  whether internalization can be achieved by individual cells or whether it
  depends on interactions within a group of cells. We found that individual
  MZoep mutant cells transplanted to the margin of wild-type blastula embryos
  initially internalize with their neighbors but are unable to contribute to
  the mesendoderm. In the reciprocal experiment, single wild-type cells
  transplanted to the margin of MZoep mutant embryos autonomously internalize
  and can express the mesendodermal markers axial/foxA2 and sox17. These
  results suggest that internalization and mesendoderm formation in zebrafish
  can be attained autonomously by single cells.}

  abstract = {The genomic developmental program operates mainly through the
  regulated expression of genes encoding transcription factors and signaling
  pathways. Complex networks of regulatory genetic interactions control
  developmental cell specification and fates. Development in the zebrafish,
  Danio rerio, has been studied extensively and large amounts of experimental
  data, including information on spatial and temporal gene expression patterns,
  are available. A wide variety of maternal and zygotic regulatory factors and
  signaling pathways have been discovered in zebrafish, and these provide a
  useful starting point for reconstructing the gene regulatory networks (GRNs)
  underlying development. In this review, we describe in detail the genetic
  regulatory subcircuits responsible for dorsoanterior-ventroposterior
  patterning and endoderm formation. We describe a number of regulatory motifs,
  which appear to act as the functional building blocks of the GRNs. Different
  positive feedback loops drive the ventral and dorsal specification processes.
  Mutual exclusivity in dorsal-ventral polarity in zebrafish is governed by
  intra-cellular cross-inhibiting GRN motifs, including vent/dharma and
  tll1/chordin. The dorsal-ventral axis seems to be determined by competition
  between two maternally driven positive-feedback loops (one operating on
  Dharma, the other on Bmp). This is the first systematic approach aimed at
  developing an integrated model of the GRNs underlying zebrafish development.
  Comparison of GRNs' organizational motifs between different species will
  provide insights into developmental specification and its evolution. The

  invagination. The finite element method is used to model this ventral furrow
  formation in 3D by decomposing the total deformation into two parts: an
  imposed active deformation, and an elastic passive deformation superimposed
  onto the latter. The model imposes as boundary conditions (i) a constant yolk
  volume and (ii) a sliding contact condition of the cells against the
  vitelline membrane, which is interpolated as a B-Spline surface. The active
  deformation simulates the effects of apical constriction and apico-basal
  elongation of cells. This set of local cellular mechanisms leads to global
  shape changes of the embryo which are associated with known gene expressions.
  Using the model we have tested different plausible hypotheses postulated to
  account for the mechanical behaviour of epithelial tissues. In particular, we
  conclude that only certain combinations of local cell shape change can
  successfully reproduce the invagination process. We have quantitatively
  compared the model with a 2D model and shown that it exhibits a more robust
  invagination phenomenon. The 3D model has also revealed that invagination
  causes a yolk flow from the central region to the anterior and posterior ends
  of the embryo, causing an accordion-like global compression and expansion
  wave to move through the embryo. Such a phenomenon cannot be described by 2D
  models.}

  curvature of the surface from which the ameloblasts migrate (the
  dentin-enamel junction or DEJ). A single unknown rate parameter is calibrated
  by an independent datum from the human tooth. With no remaining adjustable
  parameters, the theory correctly predicts aspects of the fracture-resistant,
  wavy microstructure of enamel in the human molar, including wavelength
  variations and the rate of wave amplitude damping. At a critical value of
  curvature of the DEJ, a transition in the ordering of cells occurs, from
  invariant order over the whole population to self-assembly of the population
  into groups or gangs. The prediction of an ordering transition and the
  predicted critical curvature are consistent with gnarled enamel in the cusps

  early segmentation, zebrafish YSL nuclei display several highly patterned
  movements, which are organized into spatially distinct morphogenetic domains
  along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes. During the late
  blastula period, with the onset of epiboly, nuclei throughout the YSL
  initiate longitudinal movements that are directed along the animal-vegetal
  axis. As epiboly progresses, nuclei progressively recede from the advancing
  margin of the epibolic YSL. However, a small group of nuclei is retained at
  the YSL margin to form a constricting blastoporal ring. During
  mid-gastrulation, YSL nuclei undergo convergent-extension behavior toward the
  dorsal midline, with a subset of nuclei forming an axial domain that
  underlies the notochord. These highly patterned movements of YSL nuclei share
  remarkable similarities to the morphogenetic movements of deep cells in the
  overlying zebrafish blastoderm. The macroscopic shape changes of the
  zebrafish yolk cell, as well as the morphogenetic movements of its YSL
  nuclei, are homologous to several morphogenetic behaviors that are regionally
  expressed within the vegetal endodermal cell mass of gastrulating Xenopus
  embryos. In contrast to the cellular endoderm of Xenopus, the dynamics of
  zebrafish YSL show that a syncytial endodermal germ layer can express a
  temporal sequence of morphogenetic domains without undergoing progressive

  most invertebrate taxa of today, in which lineage plays an important role in
  the spatial organization of the early embryo, and cell specification occurs
  in situ, by both autonomous and conditional mechanisms; Type 2, the
  vertebrate form of embryogenesis, which proceeds by mechanisms that are
  essentially independent of cell lineage, in which diffusible morphogens and
  extensive early cell migration are particularly important; Type 3, the form
  exemplified by long germ band insects in which several different regulatory
  mechanisms are used to generate precise patterns of nuclear gene expression
  prior to cellularization. Evolutionary implications of the phylogenetic
  distribution of these types of embryogenesis are considered. Regionally
  expressed homeodomain regulators are utilized in all three types of embryo,
  in similar ways in later and postembryonic development, but in different ways
  in early embryonic development. A specific downstream molecular function for

  or cancer cell migration. However, its cellular bases are just starting to be
  unraveled. During vertebrate gastrulation, axial mesendoderm migrates in a
  group, the prechordal plate, from the embryonic organizer to the animal pole.
  How this collective migration is achieved remains unclear. Previous work has
  suggested that cells migrate as individuals, with collective movement
  resulting from the addition of similar individual cell behavior. Through
  extensive analyses of cell trajectories, morphologies, and polarization in
  zebrafish embryos, we reveal that all prechordal plate cells show the same
  behavior and rely on the same signaling pathway to migrate, as expected if
  they do so individually. However, by using cell transplants, we demonstrate
  that prechordal plate migration is a true collective process, as isolated
  cells do not migrate toward the animal pole. They are still polarized and
  motile but lose directionality. Directionality is restored upon contact with
  the endogenous prechordal plate. This contact dependent orientation relies on
  E-cadherin, Wnt-PCP signaling, and Rac1. Importantly, groups of cells also
  need contact with the endogenous plate to orient correctly, showing an
  instructive role of the plate in establishing directionality. Overall, our
  results lead to an original model of collective migration in which
  directional information is contained within the moving group rather than
  provided by extrinsic cues, and constantly maintained in cells by contacts
  with their neighbors. This self-organizing model could account for collective
  invasion of new territories, as observed in cancer strands, without
  requirement for any attractant in the colonized tissue.}

  understand how individual cells transduce mechanical force into biochemical
  signals. In turn, this knowledge of mechanotransduction at the cellular level
  is beginning to clarify the role of mechanics in patterning processes during
  embryonic development. In this perspective, we will discuss current
  mechanotransduction paradigms, along with the technologies that have shaped
  the field of mechanobiology.}

  the contraction of myosin II structures spanning multiple pairs of cells

  assembly is an active process. Multicellular cables are sites of increased
  mechanical tension as measured by laser ablation. Fluorescence recovery after
  photobleaching experiments show that myosin II is stabilized at the cortex in

  ectopic force and relieving tension leads to a rapid loss of myosin,
  indicating that tension is necessary and sufficient for cortical myosin

  interpreted in terms of elasto-plastic flow of sheets. Such a model allows
  one to calculate the flow map inside the blastodisc, hence the evolution of
  its shape. In addition, the model predicts that there exists a region of high
  stress oriented radially from the caudal pole towards the center of the
  blastodisc, with a tensile component oriented orthoradially. If the stress
  generated by cellular motion is enough to provoke a crack in the extra
  cellular matrix, then mesoderm ingression proceeds through a "streak" (the
  primitive streak) oriented from the caudal pole inwards, which relieves the
  stress while it creates the three germ layers. The model predicts that crack
  opening is next followed by crack retreat (primitive streak retreat), as
  mesoderm ingression continues. As mesoderm ingression proceeds around the
  area pellucida, similar phenomena in the anterior pole may contribute to
  formation of the embryo. This gives a mechanical description of avian
  gastrulation which complements the biochemical approach. In addition, the
  model provides a simple explanation to the shape of the embryo at very early
  stages, and possibly an explanation of the entry point of the vitteline
  arteries into the mesoderm.}

  instructions. I have filmed by time-lapse microscopy the formation of the
  presumptive head territory in chicken embryos. I show that the early lateral
  evagination of the eye cups and of the mesencephalic plate is a consequence
  of a sudden change in boundary conditions of the initial cell flow occurring
  in these embryos. Due to tissue flow, and collision of the two halves of the
  embryo, the tissue sheet movement is first dipolar, and next quadrupolar. In
  vivo air puff tonometry reveals a simple visco-elastic behaviour of the
  living material. The jump from a dipolar to a quadrupolar flow changes the
  topology of the early morphogenetic field which is observed towards a complex
  vortex winding with a trail (the eye cups and brain folds). The
  hydrodynamical model accounts for the discontinuity of the vector field at

  Differentiation of the EVL requires the maternal effect gene poky/ikk1 in EVL
  cells prior to establishment of the basal layer. This requirement is
  transient and maternal Ikk1 is sufficient to allow establishment of the EVL
  and formation of normal skin in adults. Similar to the requirement for Ikk1
  in mouse epidermis, EVL cells in poky mutants fail to exit the cell cycle or
  express specific markers of differentiation. In spite of the similarity in
  phenotype, the molecular requirement for Ikk1 is different between mouse and
  zebrafish. Unlike the mouse, EVL differentiation requires functioning
  Poky/Ikk1 kinase activity but does not require the HLH domain. Previous work
  suggested that the EVL was a transient embryonic structure, and that
  maturation of the epidermis required replacement of the EVL with cells from
  the basal layer. We show here that the EVL is not lost during embryogenesis
  but persists to larval stages. Our results show that while the requirement
  for poky/ikk1 is conserved, the differences in molecular activity indicate
  that diversification of an epithelial differentiation program has allowed at
  least two developmental modes of establishing a multilayered epidermis in
  vertebrates.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut formation is a key event during animal
  development. Recent genetic analysis in chick, mice, and Drosophila has
  identified Hedgehog and TGFbeta signals as essential players for the
  development of the primitive gut tube along its anterior-posterior (AP) axis.
  However, the genetic programs that control gut patterning along its
  dorsoventral (DV) axis have remained largely elusive. RESULTS: We demonstrate
  that the activation of the Notch receptor occurs in a single row of boundary
  cells which separates dorsal from ventral cells in the Drosophila hindgut.
  rhomboid, which encodes a transmembrane protein, and knirps/knirps-related,
  which encode nuclear steroid receptors, are Notch target genes required for
  the expression of crumbs, which encodes a transmembrane protein involved in
  organizing apical-basal polarity. Notch receptor activation depends on the
  expression of its ligand Delta in ventral cells, and localizing the Notch
  receptor to the apical domain of the boundary cells may be required for
  proper signaling. The analysis of gene expression mediated by a Notch
  response element suggests that boundary cell-specific expression can be
  obtained by cooperation of Suppressor of Hairless and the transcription
  factor Grainyhead or a related factor. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate
  that Notch signaling plays a pivotal role in determining cell fates along the
  DV axis of the Drosophila hindgut. The finding that Notch signaling results
  in the expression of an apical polarity organizer which may be required, in
  turn, for apical Notch receptor localization suggests a simple mechanism by
  which the specification of a single cell row might be controlled.}

  confirm a robust and nearly identical correlation between local cell topology
  and cleavage-plane orientation in vivo. Using simple mathematics, we show

  orientation, and that cleavage-plane bias may be a widespread property of
  polygonal cell sheets in plants and animals.}

  We used microfabrication to build model mammary epithelial tissues of defined

  factors. Branches initiated from sites of high mechanical stress within the
  tissues, as predicted numerically and measured directly using 3D traction
  force microscopy. Branch sites were defined by activation of focal adhesion
  kinase (FAK), inhibition of which disrupted morphogenesis. Stress, FAK
  activation, and branching were all altered by manipulating cellular
  contractility, matrix stiffness, intercellular cohesion and tissue geometry.
  These data suggest that the pattern and magnitude of mechanical stress across

  abstract = {The formation of somites in the course of vertebrate segmentation
  is governed by an oscillator known as the segmentation clock, which is
  characterized by a period ranging from 30 min to a few hours depending on the
  organism. This oscillator permits the synchronized activation of segmentation
  genes in successive cohorts of cells in the presomitic mesoderm in response
  to a periodic signal emitted by the segmentation clock, thereby defining the
  future segments. Recent microarray experiments [Dequeant, M.L., Glynn, E.,
  Gaudenz, K., Wahl, M., Chen, J., Mushegian, A., Pourquie, O., 2006. A complex
  oscillating network of signaling genes underlies the mouse segmentation
  clock. Science 314, 1595-1598] indicate that the Notch, Wnt and Fibroblast
  Growth Factor (FGF) signaling pathways are involved in the mechanism of the
  segmentation clock. By means of computational modeling, we investigate the
  conditions in which sustained oscillations occur in these three signaling
  pathways. First we show that negative feedback mediated by the Lunatic Fringe
  protein on intracellular Notch activation can give rise to periodic behavior
  in the Notch pathway. We then show that negative feedback exerted by Axin2 on
  the degradation of beta-catenin through formation of the Axin2 destruction
  complex can produce oscillations in the Wnt pathway. Likewise, negative
  feedback on FGF signaling mediated by the phosphatase product of the gene
  MKP3/Dusp6 can produce oscillatory gene expression in the FGF pathway.
  Coupling the Wnt, Notch and FGF oscillators through common intermediates can
  lead to synchronized oscillations in the three signaling pathways or to
  complex periodic behavior, depending on the relative periods of oscillations
  in the three pathways. The phase relationships between cycling genes in the
  three pathways depend on the nature of the coupling between the pathways and
  on their relative autonomous periods. The model provides a framework for
  analyzing the dynamics of the segmentation clock in terms of a network of
  oscillating modules involving the Wnt, Notch and FGF signaling pathways.}

  desmoglein (Dsg), are the adhesion molecules of desmosomes, intercellular
  adhesive junctions of epithelia and cardiac muscle. Both the DCs and
  desmosomes have demonstrably essential roles in mammalian development. In
  order to initiate their study in a more tractable developmental system we
  have characterised zebrafish DCs and examined their roles in early zebrafish
  development. RESULTS:We find that zebrafish possess one Dsc, the orthologue
  of mammalian Dsc1, which we designate zfDsc. Unlike mammalian Dscs, zfDsc
  exists only as the "a" form since it lacks the alternatively-spliced
  mini-exon that shortens the cytoplasmic domain to produce the "b" form.
  Zebrafish possess two Dsgs, designated zfDsgα and zfDsgβ, orthologues of
  mammalian Dsg2. They show 43.8% amino acid identity and the α form has a 43
  amino acid glycine-rich sequence of unknown function in its extracellular
  domain. Both zfDsc and zfDsgα were present as maternal and zygotic
  transcripts whereas zfDsgβ was first expressed from 8 hours
  post-fertilisation (hpf). All three transcripts were present throughout
  subsequent stages of development. Morpholino knockdown of both zfDsc and
  zfDsgα expression produced similar defects in epiboly, axis elongation and
  somite formation, associated with abnormal desmosomes or reduced desmosome
  numbers. CONCLUSIONS:These results demonstrate an important role for DCs and
  desmosomes in the early morphogenesis of the zebrafish embryo, provide a
  basis for more detailed analysis of their role and raise interesting
  questions relating to the evolution and functional significance of DC
  isoforms.}

  In many organisms, specification of the dorsoventral axis requires signalling

  show that maternal transcripts of the zebrafish Nodal-related morphogen,
  Squint (Sqt), can localize to two blastomeres at the four-cell stage and
  predict the dorsal axis. Removal of cells containing sqt transcripts from
  four-to-eight-cell embryos or injection of antisense morpholino
  oligonucleotides targeting sqt into oocytes can cause a loss of dorsal
  structures. Localization of sqt transcripts is independent of maternal Wnt
  pathway function and requires a highly conserved sequence in the 3'
  untranslated region. Thus, the dorsoventral axis is apparent by early
  cleavage stages and may require the maternally encoded morphogen Sqt and its
  associated factors. Because the 3' untranslated region of the human nodal
  gene can also localize exogenous sequences to dorsal cells, this mechanism
  may be evolutionarily conserved.}

  important to utilize mathematical models to understand how microscopic
  intercellular interactions lead to the macroscopic pattern formation
  ubiquitous in the biological world. Modeling methodologies come in a large
  variety and presently it is unclear what is their interrelationship and the
  assumptions implicit in their use. They can be broadly divided into three
  categories according to the spatial scale they purport to describe: the
  molecular, the cellular and the tissue scales. Most models address dynamics
  at the tissue-scale, few address the cellular scale and very few address the
  molecular scale. Of course there would be no dissent between models or at
  least the underlying assumptions would be known if they were all rigorously
  derived from a molecular level model, in which case the laws of physics and
  chemistry are very well known. However in practice this is not possible due
  to the immense complexity of the problem. A simpler approach is to derive
  models at a coarse scale from an intermediate scale model which has the
  special property of being based on biology and physics which are
  experimentally well studied. In this article we use such an approach to
  understand the assumptions inherent in the use of the most popular models,
  the tissue-level ones. Such models are found to invariably rely on the hidden
  assumption that statistical correlations between cells can be neglected. This
  often means that the predictions of these models are qualitatively correct
  but may fail in spatial regions where cell concentration is small,
  particularly if there are strong long-range correlations in cell movement.
  Such behavior can only be properly taken into account by cellular models.
  However such models unlike the tissue-level models are frequently not easily
  amenable to analysis, except when the number of interacting cells is small or
  when the interactions are weak, and thus are rather more suited for
  simulation. Hence it is our conclusion that the simultaneous theoretical and
  numerical analysis of models of the same biological system at different
  spatial scales provides a more robust method of understanding biological
  systems than the utilization of a single scale model. In particular this
  enables one to clearly separate nonphysical predictions stemming from model
  artifacts from those due to genuine physiological behavior.}

  of the NE to control NE dynamics is unclear. We address this in the early
  Drosophila embryo, in which profound changes in NE shape parallel the
  transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. We show that microtubule
  (MT) polymerization events produce the elementary forces necessary for NE
  dynamics. Moreover, large-scale NE deformations associated with groove
  formation require concentration of MT polymerization in bundles organized by
  Dynein. However, MT bundles cannot produce grooves when the farnesylated
  inner nuclear membrane protein Kugelkern (Kuk) is absent. Although it
  increases stiffness of the NE, Kuk also stabilizes NE deformations emerging
  from the collective effect of MT polymerization forces concentrated in
  bundles. Finally, we report that MT-induced NE deformations control the
  dynamics of chromatin and its organization at steady state. Thus, the NE is a
  dynamic organelle, fluctuations of which increase chromatin dynamics. We
  propose that such mechanical regulation of chromatin dynamics by MTs might be
  important for gene regulation.}

  transcribed specifically in the caudal precursor region and is down-regulated

  understanding the progressive down-regulation of FGF8 and its coordination
  with the caudal movement of cells which is also known to be FGF-signaling

  simulations. We use an individual-based hybrid model as well as a caricature
  continuous model for the simulation of experimental observations (ours and

  drive differentiation and cell movement during the axis elongation. Using
  these models we have identified a possible gene regulatory network involving
  self-repression of a caudal morphogen coupled to directional domain movement
  that may account for progressive down-regulation of FGF8 and conservation of
  the FGF8 domain of expression. Furthermore, we have shown that chemotaxis
  driven by molecules, such as FGF8 secreted in the stem zone, could underlie
  the migration of the caudal precursor zone and, therefore, embryonic axis
  extension. These mechanisms may also be at play in other developmental

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many species form extraembryonic tissues during
  embryogenesis, such as the placenta of humans and other viviparous mammals.
  Extraembryonic tissues have various roles in protecting, nourishing and
  patterning embryos. Prior to gastrulation in zebrafish, the yolk syncytial
  layer - an extraembryonic nuclear syncytium - produces signals that induce
  mesoderm and endoderm formation. Mesoderm and endoderm precursor cells are
  situated in the embryonic margin, an external ring of cells along the
  embryo-yolk interface. The yolk syncytial layer initially forms below the
  margin, in a domain called the external yolk syncytial layer (E-YSL).
  RESULTS: We hypothesize that key components of the yolk syncytial layer's
  mesoderm and endoderm inducing activity are expressed as mRNAs in the E-YSL.
  To identify genes expressed in the E-YSL, we used microarrays to compare the
  transcription profiles of intact pre-gastrula embryos with pre-gastrula
  embryonic cells that we had separated from the yolk and yolk syncytial layer.
  This identified a cohort of genes with enriched expression in intact embryos.
  Here we describe our whole mount in situ hybridization analysis of
  sixty-eight of them. This includes ten genes with E-YSL expression
  (camsap1l1, gata3, znf503, hnf1ba, slc26a1, slc40a1, gata6, gpr137bb, otop1
  and cebpa), four genes with expression in the enveloping layer (EVL), a
  superficial epithelium that protects the embryo (zgc:136817, zgc:152778,
  slc14a2 and elovl6l), three EVL genes whose expression is transiently
  confined to the animal pole (elovl6l, zgc:136359 and clica), and six genes
  with transient maternal expression (mtf1, wu:fj59f04, mospd2, rftn2, arrdc1a
  and pho). We also assessed the requirement of Nodal signaling for the
  expression of selected genes in the E-YSL, EVL and margin. Margin expression
  was Nodal dependent for all genes we tested, including the concentrated
  margin expression of an EVL gene: zgc:110712. All other instances of EVL and
  E-YSL expression that we tested were Nodal independent. CONCLUSION: We have
  devised an effective strategy for enriching and identifying genes expressed
  in the E-YSL of pre-gastrula embryos. To our surprise, maternal genes and
  genes expressed in the EVL were also enriched by this strategy. A number of
  these genes are promising candidates for future functional studies on early
  embryonic patterning.}

  Axin2. The model produces oscillatory states of the involved constituents
  with typical time periods of a few hours (ultradian oscillations). The
  oscillations are robust to changes in parameter values and are often spiky,
  where low concentration values of beta-catenin are interrupted by sharp
  peaks. Necessary for the oscillations is the saturated degradation of Axin2.
  Somite formation in chick and mouse embryos is controlled by a spatial Wnt
  gradient which we introduce in the model through a time-dependent decrease in
  Wnt3a ligand level. We find that the oscillations disappear as the ligand
  concentration decreases, in agreement with observations on embryos.}

  are extraembryonic and the third forms the entire embryo. The domains appear
  not to subdivide during gastrulation, when the germ layers form and when
  cells probably commit to their eventual fates. The domains may signal
  specification of morphogenesis rather than cell fate, because, shortly after
  they appear, each assumes a different role during epiboly, the first
  morphogenetic movement of the embryo. During meroblastic cleavage, and
  continuing in the early blastula, zebrafish blastomeres divide rapidly and
  synchronously. At the time of the tenth cleavage, the beginning of the
  midblastula transition, the cell cycle lengthens, and, as in Xenopus and
  Drosophila, cycle length comes under nucleocytoplasmic control (D.A.K. and
  C.B.K., manuscript in preparation). This nucleocytoplasmic control seems to
  be maintained during cycle lengthening in the next 2 or 3 cycles, comprising
  a midblastula transition period. We now show that functionally distinct

  or rearrangement of cells, marginal and submarginal regions of the late
  gastrula were observed directly by time-lapse cinemicrography. Marginal cells
  rearrange to occupy submarginal positions by first narrowing their boundary
  with the external yolk syncytial layer (E-YSL), thus becoming tapered in
  shape. Then, the narrowed marginal boundary retracts from the E-YSL and moves
  submarginally in the plane of the epithelium. Concurrently, the marginal
  cells on both sides come into apposition; no gap or break appears in the
  circum-apical continuity of the epithelial sheet. Marginal cells leave the
  margin of the EVL during epiboly at a rate of about six per hour. The rate of
  movement of the EVL cells with respect to one another is about 0.5 to 1.0
  micron/min at 21 degrees C. Submarginal cells rearrange in a similar fashion.
  Although no protrusive activity was seen at the lateral aspects of
  rearranging cells, the tapering or narrowing associated with rearrangement
  was accompanied by formation of microfolds on their apical surfaces, and
  separating or recently separated submarginal cells form "flowers" of
  microfolds on their apices adjacent to the site of separation. Morphometric
  analysis shows that about half the narrowing of the margin of the EVL during
  epiboly is accounted for by cell rearrangement and the other half by the
  associated tapering and narrowing. These results suggest that epiboly of the
  EVL may have an active component as well as a passive one.}

  cell. It forms at the time of the 10th (sometimes 9th) cleavage by a collapse
  of a set of blastomeres, termed marginal blastomeres, into the yolk cell.
  Marginal blastomeres possess cytoplasmic bridges to the yolk cell before the
  YSL forms, and injections of fluorescein-dextran into the cells revealed that
  bridges between the yolk cell and blastoderm do not persist after this time.
  Injections of Lucifer yellow revealed that shortly after the YSL forms the
  yolk cell and blastoderm are dye coupled, presumably by gap junctions, and
  that this coupling disappears gradually during early gastrulation. Lineage
  analyses revealed that not all of the progeny of early marginal blastomeres
  participate in YSL formation. Although some descendants of marginal
  blastomeres remained on the margin during successive cleavages, neither
  "compartment" nor "strict lineage" models are sufficient to explain the

  requires the Ste20-like kinase Msn1, an orthologue of Drosophila Misshapen.
  Similarly, in Drosophila, actin and myosin 2 localization and cell
  constriction at the margin of the epidermis mediate dorsal closure and are
  controlled by Misshapen. Thus, this study has characterized a conserved
  mechanism underlying coordinated cell-shape changes during epithelial
  morphogenesis.}

  abstract = {We present nonlinear diffusion equations, numerical schemes to
  solve them and their application for filtering 3D images obtained from laser
  scanning microscopy (LSM) of living zebrafish embryos, with a goal to
  identify the optimal filtering method and its parameters. In the large scale
  applications dealing with analysis of 3D+time embryogenesis images, an
  important objective is a correct detection of the number and position of cell
  nuclei yielding the spatio-temporal cell lineage tree of embryogenesis. The
  filtering is the first and necessary step of the image analysis chain and
  must lead to correct results, removing the noise, sharpening the nuclei edges
  and correcting the acquisition errors related to spuriously connected
  subregions. In this paper we study such properties for the regularized
  Perona-Malik model and for the generalized mean curvature flow equations in
  the level-set formulation. A comparison with other nonlinear diffusion
  filters, like tensor anisotropic diffusion and Beltrami flow, is also
  included. All numerical schemes are based on the same discretization
  principles, i.e. finite volume method in space and semi-implicit scheme in
  time, for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. These numerical
  schemes are unconditionally stable, fast and naturally parallelizable. The
  filtering results are evaluated and compared first using the Mean Hausdorff
  distance between a gold standard and different isosurfaces of original and
  filtered data. Then, the number of isosurface connected components in a
  region of interest (ROI) detected in original and after the filtering is
  compared with the corresponding correct number of nuclei in the gold
  standard. Such analysis proves the robustness and reliability of the edge
  preserving nonlinear diffusion filtering for this type of data and lead to
  finding the optimal filtering parameters for the studied models and numerical
  schemes. Further comparisons consist in ability of splitting the very close
  objects which are artificially connected due to acquisition error
  intrinsically linked to physics of LSM. In all studied aspects it turned out
  that the nonlinear diffusion filter which is called geodesic mean curvature
  flow (GMCF) has the best performance.}

  Little is known about epigenetic states in the developing zebrafish, despite
  its importance as a model organism. We report here DNA methylation and
  histone modification profiles of promoters of developmentally-regulated genes
  (pou5f1, sox2, sox3, klf4, nnr, otx1b, nes, vasa), as well as tert and
  bactin2, in zebrafish embryos at the mid-late blastula transition, shortly
  after embryonic genome activation. We identify four classes of promoters
  based on the following profiles: (i) those enriched in marks of active genes
  (H3K9ac, H4ac, H3K4me3) without transcriptionally repressing H3K9me3 or
  H3K27me3; (ii) those enriched in H3K9ac, H4ac and H3K27me3, without H3K9me3;
  one such gene was klf4, shown by in situ hybridization to be mosaically
  expressed, likely accounting for the detection of both activating and
  repressive marks on its promoter; (iii) those enriched in H3K4me3 and
  H3K27me3 without acetylation; and (iv) those enriched in all histone
  modifications examined. Culture of embryo-derived cells under differentiation
  conditions leads to H3K9 and H4 deacetylation and H3K9 and H3K27
  trimethylation on genes that are inactivated, yielding an epigenetic profile
  similar to those of fibroblasts or muscle. All promoters however retain
  H3K4me3, indicating an uncoupling of H3K4me3 occupancy and gene expression.
  All non-CpG island developmentally-regulated promoters are DNA unmethylated
  in embryos, but hypermethylated in fibroblasts. Our results suggest that
  differentially expressed embryonic genes are regulated by various patterns of
  histone modifications on unmethylated DNA, which create a developmentally
  permissive chromatin state.}

  3-lobed rudiment is deformed by three inwardly directed point forces.
  Relationships between the physical parameters of the model (tissue viscosity,
  clefting force, surface tension) and the time course and morphology are
  explored. We find that the surface tension, clefting force, and viscosity
  ratio of the two tissues have significant effects on the branching. We
  conclude that epithelial branching in soft gels is fundamentally different

  Morphogenetic cell rearrangements such as cell sorting and mutual tissue
  spreading have been compared with the behaviors of immiscible liquids, which
  they closely resemble. Based on this similarity, it has been proposed that
  tissues behave as liquids and possess a characteristic surface tension, which
  arises as a collective, macroscopic property of groups of mobile, cohering
  cells. But how are tissue surface tensions generated? Different theories have
  been proposed to explain how mesoscopic cell properties such as cell-cell
  adhesion and contractility of cell interfaces may underlie tissue surface
  tensions. Although recent work suggests that both may be contributors, an
  explicit model for the dependence of tissue surface tension on these
  mesoscopic parameters has been missing. Here we show explicitly that the
  ratio of adhesion to cortical tension determines tissue surface tension. Our
  minimal model successfully explains the available experimental data and makes
  predictions, based on the feedback between mechanical energy and geometry,
  about the shapes of aggregate surface cells, which we verify experimentally.
  This model indicates that there is a crossover from adhesion dominated to
  cortical-tension dominated behavior as a function of the ratio between these
  two quantities.}

  are integrated across the tissue. Reducing adherens junction (AJ) levels or
  ablating actomyosin meshworks causes tissue-wide epithelial tears, which
  release tension that is predominantly oriented along the anterior-posterior
  (a-p) embryonic axis. Epithelial tears allow cells normally elongated along
  the a-p axis to constrict isotropically, which suggests that apical
  constriction generates anisotropic epithelial tension that feeds back to
  control cell shape. Epithelial tension requires the transcription factor
  Twist, which stabilizes apical myosin II, promoting the formation of a
  supracellular actomyosin meshwork in which radial actomyosin fibers are
  joined end-to-end at spot AJs. Thus, pulsed actomyosin contractions require a
  supracellular, tensile meshwork to transmit cellular forces to the tissue
  level during morphogenesis.}

  model of somitogenesis is that a posteriorly moving molecular gradient
  sequentially slows the rate of clock oscillations, resulting in a spatial
  readout of temporal oscillations. However, while molecular components of the
  clocks and wavefronts have now been identified in the pre-somitic mesoderm
  (PSM), there is not yet conclusive evidence demonstrating that the observed
  molecular wavefronts act to slow clock oscillations. Here we present an
  alternative formulation of the clock and wavefront model in which oscillator
  coupling, already known to play a key role in oscillator synchronisation,
  plays a fundamentally important role in the slowing of oscillations along the
  anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Our model has three parameters which can be
  determined, in any given species, by the measurement of three quantities: the
  clock period in the posterior PSM, somite length and the length of the PSM. A
  travelling wavefront, which slows oscillations along the AP axis, is an
  emergent feature of the model. Using the model we predict: (a) the distance
  between moving stripes of gene expression; (b) the number of moving stripes
  of gene expression and (c) the oscillator period profile along the AP axis.
  Predictions regarding the stripe data are verified using existing zebrafish
  data. We simulate a range of experimental perturbations and demonstrate how
  the model can be used to unambiguously define a reference frame along the AP
  axis. Comparing data from zebrafish, chick, mouse and snake, we demonstrate
  that: (a) variation in patterning profiles is accounted for by a single
  nondimensional parameter; the ratio of coupling strengths; and (b) the period
  profile along the AP axis is conserved across species. Thus the model is
  consistent with the idea that, although the genes involved in pattern
  propagation in the PSM vary, there is a conserved patterning mechanism across
  species.}

  measured directly by using a micromechanical force sensor array. Inhibiting
  actomyosin-based tension or cadherin-mediated connections between cells
  disrupted the spatial pattern of proliferation. These findings demonstrate

  detected abnormal restriction fragments in digests of DNA from 18 of 26 C3H

  an MMTV provirus, and the integration sites were located in at least five
  clusters over a total distance of 19 kb. A polyadenylated 2.6 kb RNA species

  enabling the exploration of a wide variety of biologically plausible cleavage
  patterns. We investigate a spectrum of models that incorporate the spatial
  impact of neighboring cells and the temporal influence of parent cells on the
  choice of cleavage plane. Our findings show that cleavage patterns generate
  "signature" equilibrium distributions of polygonal cell shapes. These
  signatures enable the inference of local cleavage parameters such as neighbor
  impact, maternal influence, and division symmetry from global observations of
  the distribution of cell shape. Applying these insights to the proliferating
  epithelia of five diverse organisms, we find that strong division symmetry
  and moderate neighbor/maternal influence are required to reproduce the
  predominance of hexagonal cells and low variability in cell shape seen
  empirically. Furthermore, we present two distinct cleavage pattern models,
  one stochastic and one deterministic, that can reproduce the empirical
  distribution of cell shapes. Although the proliferating epithelia of the five
  diverse organisms show a highly conserved cell shape distribution, there are
  multiple plausible cleavage patterns that can generate this distribution, and

  according to the regulatory logic and gene interactions specified in a GRN
  model for embryonic development in the sea urchin. Additional information

  regulatory functions and of embryonic spatial organization. The model
  computationally reproduced the altered developmental functions observed
  experimentally. Two major conclusions are that the starting GRN model

  widely analysed by numerical simulations of invagination in sea urchins and
  Drosophila gastrulation. Finite element models, which describe the tissue as
  a continuous medium, lead to the global invagination morphogenesis observed
  in vivo. Here we develop a simulation of multicellular embryo invagination
  that allows access to both cellular and multicellular mechanical behaviours
  of the embryo. In this model, the tissue is composed of adhesive individual
  cells, in which shape change dynamics is governed by internal acto-myosin
  forces and the hydrodynamic flow associated with membrane movements. We
  investigated the minimal structural and force elements sufficient to
  phenocopy mesoderm invagination. The minimal structures are cell membranes
  characterized by an acto-myosin cortical tension and connected by apical and
  basal junctions and an acto-myosin contractile ring connected to the apical
  junctions. An increase in the apical-cortical surface tension is the only
  control parameter change required to phenocopy most known multicellular and
  cellular shape changes of Drosophila gastrulation. Specifically, behaviours
  observed in vivo, including apical junction movements at the onset of
  gastrulation, cell elongation and subsequent shortening during invagination,
  and the development of a dorso-ventral gradient of thickness of the embryo,
  are predicted by this model as passive mechanical consequences of the
  genetically controlled increase in the apical surface tension in invaginating
  mesoderm cells, thus demonstrating the accurate description of structures at
  both global and single cell scales.}

  and signaling. These well-balanced cellular systems are, however, quite often
  disturbed by genetic or environmental cues that may lead to the formation of

  epithelial structure, as well as the features of the acinar structure that
  are modified during cancer development as observable in experimental and

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tissue morphogenesis is a complex process whereby
  tissue structures self-assemble by the aggregate behaviors of independently
  acting cells responding to both intracellular and extracellular cues in their
  environment. During embryonic development, morphogenesis is particularly
  important for organizing cells into tissues, and although key regulatory
  events of this process are well studied in isolation, a number of important
  systems-level questions remain unanswered. This is due, in part, to a lack of
  integrative tools that enable the coupling of biological phenomena across
  spatial and temporal scales. Here, we present a new computational framework
  that integrates intracellular signaling information with multi-cell behaviors
  in the context of a spatially heterogeneous tissue environment. RESULTS: We
  have developed a computational simulation of mesendoderm migration in the
  Xenopus laevis explant model, which is a well studied biological model of
  tissue morphogenesis that recapitulates many features of this process during
  development in humans. The simulation couples, via a JAVA interface, an
  ordinary differential equation-based mass action kinetics model to compute
  intracellular Wnt/beta-catenin signaling with an agent-based model of
  mesendoderm migration across a fibronectin extracellular matrix substrate.
  The emergent cell behaviors in the simulation suggest the following
  properties of the system: maintaining the integrity of cell-to-cell contact
  signals is necessary for preventing fractionation of cells as they move,
  contact with the Fn substrate and the existence of a Fn gradient provides an
  extracellular feedback loop that governs migration speed, the incorporation
  of polarity signals is required for cells to migrate in the same direction,
  and a delicate balance of integrin and cadherin interactions is needed to
  reproduce experimentally observed migratory behaviors. CONCLUSION: Our
  computational framework couples two different spatial scales in biology:
  intracellular with multicellular. In our simulation, events at one scale have
  quantitative and dynamic impact on events at the other scale. This
  integration enables the testing and identification of key systems-level
  hypotheses regarding how signaling proteins affect overall tissue-level
  behavior during morphogenesis in an experimentally verifiable system.
  Applications of this approach extend to the study of tissue patterning
  processes that occur during adulthood and disease, such as tumorgenesis and
  atherogenesis.}

  be used to represent a single cell in more detail, by using a larger number

  significant coordinated cell movement lateral to the streak, in addition to
  the posterior-anterior movement of cells in the streak proper. Cells lateral
  to the streak are observed to undergo 'polonaise movements', i.e. two large

  we propose a mechanism for these movement patterns which relies on
  chemotactic signals emitted by a dipolar configuration of cells in the
  posterior region of the epiblast. The 'chemotactic dipole' consists of
  adjacent regions of cells emitting chemo-attractants and chemo-repellents. We
  motivate this idea using a mathematical analogy between chemotaxis and
  electrostatics, and test this idea using large-scale computer simulations. We
  implement active cell response to both neighboring mechanical interactions
  and chemotactic gradients using the Subcellular Element Model. Simulations
  show the emergence of large-scale vortices of cell movement. The length and
  time scales of vortex formation are in reasonable agreement with experimental
  data. We also provide quantitative estimates for the robustness of the
  chemotaxis dipole mechanism, which indicate that the mechanism has an error
  tolerance of about 10% to variation in chemotactic parameters, assuming that
  only 1% of the cell population is involved in emitting signals. This
  tolerance increases for larger populations of cells emitting signals.}

  Cells change their behavior in response to external biochemical and
  biomechanical cues. Behavioral changes, such as morphological deformation,
  proliferation and migration, are striking in many multicellular processes
  such as morphogenesis, wound healing and cancer progression. Cell-based
  modeling of these phenomena requires algorithms that can capture active cell
  behavior and their emergent tissue-level phenotypes. In this paper, we report
  on extensions of the subcellular element model to model active biomechanical
  subcellular processes. These processes lead to emergent cell and tissue level
  phenotypes at larger scales, including (i) adaptive shape deformations in
  cells responding to slow stretching, (ii) viscous flow of embryonic tissues,
  and (iii) streaming patterns of chemotactic cells in epithelial-like sheets.
  In each case, we connect our simulation results to recent experiments.}

  abstract = {In zebrafish (Danio rerio), meroblastic cleavages generate an
  embryo in which blastomeres cover the animal pole of a large yolk cell. At
  the 500-1000 cell stage, the marginal blastomeres fuse with the yolk cell
  forming the yolk syncytial layer. During epiboly the blastoderm and the yolk
  syncytial layer spread toward the vegetal pole. We have studied developmental
  changes in organization and function during epiboly of two distinct
  microtubule arrays located in the cortical cytoplasm of the yolk cell. In the
  anuclear yolk cytoplasmic layer, an array of microtubules extends along the
  animal-vegetal axis to the vegetal pole. In the early blastula the yolk
  cytoplasmic layer microtubules appear to originate from the marginal
  blastomeres. Once formed, the yolk syncytial layer exhibits its own network
  of intercrossing mitotic or interphase microtubules. The microtubules of the
  yolk cytoplasmic layer emanate from the microtubule network of the syncytial
  layer. At the onset of epiboly, the external yolk syncytial layer narrows,
  the syncytial nuclei become tightly packed and the network of intercrossing
  microtubules surrounding them becomes denser. Soon after, there is a vegetal
  expansion of the blastoderm and of the yolk syncytial layer with its network
  of intercrossing microtubules. Concomitantly, the yolk cytoplasmic layer
  diminishes and its set of animal-vegetal microtubules becomes shorter. We
  investigated the involvement of microtubules in epiboly using the microtubule
  depolymerizing agent nocodazole and a stabilizing agent taxol. In embryos
  treated with nocodazole, microtubules were absent and epibolic movements of
  the yolk syncytial nuclei were blocked. In contrast, the vegetal expansion of
  the enveloping layer and deep cells was only partially inhibited. The process
  of endocytosis, proposed to play a major role in epiboly of the yolk
  syncytial layer (Betchaku, T. and Trinkaus, J. P. (1986) Am. Zool. 26,
  193-199), was still observed in nocodazole-treated embryos. Treatment of
  embryos with taxol led to a delay in all epibolic movements. We propose that
  the yolk cell microtubules contribute either directly or indirectly to all
  epibolic movements. However, the epibolic movements of the yolk syncytial
  layer nuclei and of the blastoderm are not coupled, and only movements of the
  yolk syncytial nuclei are absolutely dependent on microtubules. We
  hypothesize that the microtubule network of the syncytial layer and the
  animal-vegetal set of the yolk cytoplasmic layer contribute differently to
  various aspects of epiboly. Models that address the mechanisms by which the
  two microtubule arrays might function during epiboly are discussed.}

  to consider the objects boundaries in one image as semi-permeable membranes
  and to let the other image, considered as a deformable grid model, diffuse
  through these interfaces, by the action of effectors situated within the
  membranes. We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell's demons. We
  show that this concept relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction,
  with an intermediate step being optical flow techniques. We use the concept
  of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms,
  one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only
  contour points, and a last one operating on already segmented images.
  Finally, we present results with synthesized deformations and real medical
  images, with applications to heart motion tracking and three-dimensional
  inter-patients matching.}

  presomitic mesoderm. The clock is realised through cycling expression of
  genes such as Hes1 and Hes7, whose gene products repress the transcription of
  their encoding genes in a negative feedback loop. By coupling the decay of
  the Hes1 mRNA to a gradient with the same features and mechanism of formation
  as the mesodermal Fgf8 gradient we can simulate typical features of the
  dynamic expression pattern of Hes1 in the presomitic mesoderm. Furthermore,
  our program is able to synchronise Hes1 oscillations in thousands of cells

  studied utilizing time-lapse cinemicrography and electron microscopy.
  Time-lapse films reveal that cells of the enveloping layer undulate and
  sometimes separate briefly but remain together in a cohesive layer. During
  epiboly, the marginal enveloping layer cells move over the periblast as it
  expands over the yolk sphere. Movement occurs as a result of ruffled membrane
  activity of the free borders of the marginal cells. Deep blastomeres become
  increasingly active during blastula and gastrula stages. Lobopodia project
  from the blastomeres in blastulae and adhere to other cells in gastrulae,
  giving the cells traction for movement. Contact specializations are formed by
  the lateral adjacent plasma membranes of enveloping layer cells. An apical
  junction is characterized by an intercellular gap of 60-75 A. Below this
  contact, the plasma membranes are separated by 120 A or more. In
  mid-gastrulae, cytoplasmic fibrils occur adjacent to some apical junctions,
  and small desmosomes appear below the apical junction. Septate desmosomes
  also appear at this time. A junction with an intercellular gap of 60 A occurs
  between marginal enveloping layer cells and periblast. Contacts between deep
  blastomeres become numerous in gastrulae and consist of contacts at the
  crests of surface undulations, short areas of contact in which the plasma
  membranes are 60 or 120 A apart, and long regions characterized by a 200-A
  intercellular gap. Lobopodia contact other blastomeres only in gastrulae.
  These junctions contain a 200-A intercellular space. Some deep blastomeres
  are in contact with the tips of periblast microvilli. The mechanism of
  epiboly in Fundulus is discussed and reevaluated in terms of these
  observations. The enveloping layer is adherent to the margin of the periblast
  and moves over it as a coherent cellular sheet. Periblast epiboly involves a
  controlled flow of cytoplasm from the thicker periblast into the thinner yolk
  cytoplasmic layer with which it is continuous. Deep cells move by adhering to
  each other, to the inner surface of the enveloping layer, and to the
  periblast.}

  with weak adhesion of the trailing edge: it remains rounded, without large
  retraction fibers, and it advances continuously with advance of the leading
  edge, not sporadically, as it would if it adhered strongly. (2) In contrast,
  when stationary cells in close contact separate, they remain connected at
  first by large retraction fibers, suggesting strong punctate adhesions. (3)
  Fundulus deep cells appear to move in two ways: a) protrusion of blebs,
  followed by much cytoplasmic flow; b) spreading of lamellipodia, preceded by
  filopodia and frequent cell shortening. Locomotion by shortening of a long
  lobopodium is really a form of spreading movement, since the tip of a
  lobopodium always spreads. (4) Filopodia were not found except at the leading
  edge of a spreading lamellipodium and often spread themselves; perhaps
  filopodia and lamellipodia are interconvertible. (5) A lamellipodial margin
  may form undulations in vivo that move backward like ruffles in vitro. (6) At

  microfabrication techniques to allow epithelial cell sheets to migrate into
  strips whose width was varied from one up to several cell diameters, we
  identified the modes of collective migration in response to geometrical
  constraints. We observed that a decrease in the width of the strips is
  accompanied by an overall increase in the speed of the migrating cell sheet.
  Moreover, large-scale vortices over tens of cell lengths appeared in the wide
  strips whereas a contraction-elongation type of motion is observed in the
  narrow strips. Velocity fields and traction force signatures within the
  cellular population revealed migration modes with alternative pulling and/or
  pushing mechanisms that depend on extrinsic constraints. Force transmission
  through intercellular contacts plays a key role in this process because the
  disruption of cell-cell junctions abolishes directed collective migration and
  passive cell-cell adhesions tend to move the cells uniformly together
  independent of the geometry. Altogether, these findings not only demonstrate
  the existence of patterns of collective cell migration depending on external
  constraints but also provide a mechanical explanation for how large-scale
  interactions through cell-cell junctions can feed back to regulate the

  positions of deep cells, as the blastoderm thins and spreads across the yolk
  cell. (2) Involution at or near the blastoderm margin occurs during
  gastrulation. This movement folds the blastoderm into two cellular layers,
  the epiblast and hypoblast, within a ring (the germ ring) around its entire
  circumference. Involuting cells move anteriorwards in the hypoblast relative
  to cells that remain in the epiblast; the movement shears the positions of
  cells that were neighbors before gastrulation. Involuting cells eventually
  form endoderm and mesoderm, in an anterior-posterior sequence according to
  the time of involution. The epiblast is equivalent to embryonic ectoderm. (3)
  Mediolateral cell intercalations in both the epiblast and hypoblast mediate
  convergence and extension movements towards the dorsal side of the gastrula.
  By this rearrangement, cells that were initially neighboring one another
  become dispersed along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Epiboly,

  on cadherins occur in vivo through interactions with neighboring cells, and

  These collective movements can be controlled by short- or long-range dynamic
  gradients of extracellular signalling molecules, depending on the number of
  cells involved and their distance of migration. These gradients are sensed by
  some or all of the migrating cells and translated into directed migration,
  which in many settings is further modulated by cell-contact-mediated
  attractive or repulsive interactions that result in contact-following or
  contact-inhibition of locomotion, respectively. Studies of collective
  migration of groups of epithelial cells during development indicate that, in
  some cases, only leader cells sense and migrate up an external signal
  gradient, and that adjacent cells follow through strong cell-cell contacts.

  differently sized cell populations during the development of several model

  abstract = {Many morphogenetic processes are accomplished by coordinated cell
  rearrangements. These rearrangements are accompanied by substantial shifts in
  the neighbor relationships between cells. Here we propose a model for
  studying morphogenesis in epithelial sheets by directed cell neighbor change.
  Our model describes cell rearrangements by accounting for the balance of
  forces between neighboring cells within an epithelium. Cell rearrangement and
  cell shape changes occur when these forces are not in mechanical equilibrium.
  We will show that cell rearrangement within the epidermal enveloping layer
  (EVL) of the teleost fish Fundulus during epiboly can be explained solely in
  terms of the balance of forces generated among constituent epithelial cells.
  Within a cell, we account for circumferential elastic forces and the force
  generated by hydrostatic and osmotic pressure. The model treats epithelial
  cells as two-dimensional polygons where the mechanical forces are applied to
  the polygonal nodes. A cell node protrudes or contracts when the nodal forces
  are not in mechanical equilibrium. In an epithelial sheet, adjacent cells
  share common boundary nodes; in this way, mechanical force is transmitted
  from cell to cell, mimicking junctional coupling. These junctional nodes can
  slide, and nodes may appear or disappear, so that the number of polygonal
  sides is variable. Computer graphics allows us to compare numerical
  simulations of the model with time-lapse cinemicroscopy of cell
  rearrangements in the living embryo, and data obtained from fixed and silver
  stained embryos. By manipulating the mechanical properties of the model cells
  we can study the conditions necessary to reproduce normal cell behavior
  during Fundulus epiboly. We find that simple stress relaxation is sufficient
  to account for cell rearrangements among interior cells of the EVL when they
  are isotropically contractile. Experimental observations show that the number
  of EVL marginal cells continuously decreases throughout epiboly. In order for
  the simulation to reproduce this behavior, cells at the EVL boundary must
  generate protrusive forces rather than contractile tension forces. Therefore,
  the simulation results suggest that the mechanical properties of EVL marginal
  cells at their leading edge must be quite different from EVL interior cells.}

  movements. It is possible that a few rules governing cell behavior could
  orchestrate the shaping of the entire tissue. We test this hypothesis by
  constructing a computer model of the tissue to investigate how rules
  governing cell motility and cell-cell interactions can account for the major
  features of notochord morphogenesis. These rules are drawn from the
  literature on in vitro cell studies and experimental observations of
  notochord cell behavior. The following types of motility rules are
  investigated: (1) refractory tissue boundaries that inhibit cell motility,
  (2) statistical persistence of motion, (3) contact inhibition of protrusion
  between cells, and (4) polarized and nonpolarized protrusive activity. We
  show that only the combination of refractory boundaries, contact inhibition
  and polarized protrusive activity reproduces normal notochord development.
  Guided by these rules, cells spontaneously align into a parallel array of
  elongating cells. Self alignment optimizes the geometric conditions for
  polarized protrusive activity by progressively minimizing contact inhibition
  between cells. Cell polarization, initiated at refractory tissue boundaries,
  spreads along successive cell rows into the tissue interior as cells restrict
  and constrain their neighbors' directional bias. The model demonstrates that
  several experimentally observed intrinsic cell behaviors, operating

  in pattern formation during development. The strong version of positional
  information states that there is a cell parameter, positional value, which is
  related to position as in a coordinate system and which determines cell
  differentiation. A weaker version merely emphasises position as a key
  determinant in cell development and differentiation. There is evidence for
  boundaries and orthogonal axes playing an important role in positional
  systems. A positional signal is distinguished from an inductive interaction
  because the former specifies multiple states, confers polarity, and can act
  over a long range. A gradient in a diffusible morphogen is just one way of
  specifying position. There is now good evidence in several systems for
  substances which may be the morphogen for positional signalling. The product
  of the bicoid gene in early Drosophila development is the best prospect.
  Retinoic acid is unique in its ability to alter positional value and may also
  be a morphogen. The best evidence for positional value, a concept fundamental
  to positional information, remains a biological assay based on grafting. The
  idea of positional value uncouples differentiation and position, and allows
  considerable freedom for patterning. It is not clear whether positional value
  or differentiation involves a combinatorial mechanism. Interpretation of
  positional information remains a central problem. There is good evidence that
  cells can respond differentially to less than a two-fold change in
  concentration of a chemical signal. It may be that interpretation involves
  listing the sites at which a particular class of cell differentiation will
  occur. The problem is made less severe when blocks of cells are specified
  together as in mechanisms based on an isomorphic prepattern. Isomorphic
  prepatterns could establish repeated structures which are equivalent and
  which are then made non-equivalent by positional information. This would
  enable local differences to develop. The combination of these two mechanisms
  may be wide-spread. There is evidence that positional signals within a single
  animal and in related animals are conserved. It is not clear just how wide
  this conservation is, but it is at phylotypic stages, rather than in eggs,
  that similarity might be expected. It is nevertheless impressive that the
  polar coordinate model can be applied to regulation in systems as diverse as
  insects, vertebrates and protozoa. The molecular basis of positional
  signalling is just becoming accessible; the molecular basis of positional
  value is still awaited. A brief personal history of positional information is
  provided in an appendix.}

  generation of siRNAs and heterochromatin assembly by RNAi is triggered by a
  mechanism involving the canonical poly(A) polymerase Pla1 and an associated
  RNA surveillance factor Red1, which also activate the exosome. Notably, siRNA
  production and heterochromatin modifications at these target loci are
  regulated by environmental growth conditions, and by developmental signals
  that induce gene expression during sexual differentiation. Our analyses
  uncover an interaction between RNAi and the exosome that is conserved in

  waves that propagate exclusively through the external YSL (E-YSL). Starting
  abruptly just after doming (~4.5h post-fertilization: hpf), and ending at the
  shield stage (~6.0hpf) these distinct classes of waves propagated at mean
  velocities of ~50 and ~4μm/s, respectively. Although the number and pattern
  of these waves varied between embryos, their initiation site and arcs of
  propagation displayed a distinct dorsal bias, suggesting an association with
  the formation and maintenance of the nascent dorsal-ventral axis. Wave
  initiation coincided with a characteristic clustering of YSL nuclei (YSN),
  and their associated perinuclear ER, in the E-YSL. Furthermore, the inter-YSN
  distance (IND) appeared to be critical such that Ca(2+) wave propagation
  occurred only when this was <~8μm; an IND >~8μm was coincidental with wave
  termination at shield stage. Treatment with the IP(3)R antagonist, 2-APB, the
  Ca(2+) buffer, 5,5'-dibromo BAPTA, and the SERCA-pump inhibitor,
  thapsigargin, resulted in a significant disruption of the E-YSL Ca(2+) waves,
  whereas exposure to the RyR antagonists, ryanodine and dantrolene, had no
  significant effect. These findings led us to propose that the E-YSL Ca(2+)
  waves are generated mainly via Ca(2+) release from IP(3)Rs located in the
  perinuclear ER, and that the clustering of the YSN is an essential step in
  providing a CICR pathway required for wave propagation. This article is part

  abstract = {As the zebrafish embryo undergoes gastrulation and epiboly, the
  cells of the enveloping layer (EVL) expand, covering the entire yolk cell.
  During the epiboly process, the EVL cells move as a coherent layer, remaining
  tightly attached to each other and to the underlying yolk syncytial layer
  (YSL). In view of the central role of the actin cytoskeleton, in both cell
  motility and cell-cell adhesion, we have labeled these cells in situ with
  fluorescent phalloidin and anti-actin antibodies. We show that, throughout
  their migration, the EVL cells retain a conspicuous cortical actin
  cytoskeletal belt coinciding with cell surface cadherins. At the margins
  approaching the YSL, the EVL cells extend, from their apicolateral domains,
  actin-rich filopodial protrusions devoid of detectable cadherin. We have
  studied the role of the actin cytoskeleton in the maintenance of EVL cohesion
  during epiboly. Cytochalasin treatment of embryos induces EVL dissociation
  accompanied by general detachment of the rest of the embryonic cells. In the
  dissociating EVL cells, the cortical actin belt undergoes fragmentation with
  the formation of actin aggregates; cadherins, on the other hand, remain
  evenly distributed at the junctional cell surface. Removal of Ca2+ by
  ethyleneglycolbis (amino-ethyl-ether)-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) treatment also
  induces cell dissociation without visible disruption of the cortical actin
  belt. The protein kinase inhibitor
  (1-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine dihydrochloride (H-7), which
  blocks acto-myosin contractility and disrupts actin cables in cultured cells,
  also potentiates cytochalasin-induced dissociation and promotes the
  projection of numerous actin-rich lamellipodial extensions. The fact that EVL
  cells produce microspike-like structures towards the YSL and are capable of
  lamellipodial activity lend further support to the suggestion (R.W. Keller
  and J.P. Trinkaus. 1987. Dev. Biol. 120: 12-24) that the EVL cells are not
  passively mobilized on the expanding YSL but actively participate in
  epiboly.}

  monolayer of epithelial cells that acts as a nutrient absorptive engine and
  protective barrier. To maintain its integrity and functionality, the
  epithelium is renewed every few days. Theoretical models are powerful tools
  that can be used to test hypotheses concerning the regulation of this renewal
  process, to investigate how its dysfunction can lead to loss of homeostasis
  and neoplasia, and to identify potential therapeutic interventions. Here we
  propose a new multiscale model for crypt dynamics that links phenomena
  occurring at the subcellular, cellular and tissue levels of organisation.
  METHODS: At the subcellular level, deterministic models characterise
  molecular networks, such as cell-cycle control and Wnt signalling. The output
  of these models determines the behaviour of each epithelial cell in response
  to intra-, inter- and extracellular cues. The modular nature of the model
  enables us to easily modify individual assumptions and analyse their effects
  on the system as a whole. RESULTS: We perform virtual microdissection and
  labelling-index experiments, evaluate the impact of various model extensions,
  obtain new insight into clonal expansion in the crypt, and compare our
  predictions with recent mitochondrial DNA mutation data. CONCLUSIONS: We
  demonstrate that relaxing the assumption that stem-cell positions are fixed
  enables clonal expansion and niche succession to occur. We also predict that
  the presence of extracellular factors near the base of the crypt alone
  suffices to explain the observed spatial variation in nuclear beta-catenin
  levels along the crypt axis.}

  abstract = {All insects possess homologous segments, but segment
  specification differs radically among insect orders. In Drosophila, maternal
  morphogens control the patterned activation of gap genes, which encode
  transcriptional regulators that shape the patterned expression of pair-rule
  genes. This patterning cascade takes place before cellularization. Pair-rule
  gene products subsequently 'imprint' segment polarity genes with reiterated
  patterns, thus defining the primordial segments. This mechanism must be
  greatly modified in insect groups in which many segments emerge only after
  cellularization. In beetles and parasitic wasps, for instance, pair-rule
  homologues are expressed in patterns consistent with roles during
  segmentation, but these patterns emerge within cellular fields. In contrast,
  although in locusts pair-rule homologues may not control segmentation, some
  segment polarity genes and their interactions are conserved. Perhaps
  segmentation is modular, with each module autonomously expressing a
  characteristic intrinsic behaviour in response to transient stimuli. If so,
  evolution could rearrange inputs to modules without changing their intrinsic
  behaviours. Here we suggest, using computer simulations, that the Drosophila
  segment polarity genes constitute such a module, and that this module is
  resistant to variations in the kinetic constants that govern its behaviour.}
