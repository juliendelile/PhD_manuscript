abstract = {The gene regulatory apparatus that directs development is encoded in the DNA, in the form of organized arrays of transcription factor target sites. Genes are regulated by interactions with multiple transcription factors and the target sites for the transcription factors required for the control of each gene constitute its cis-regulatory system. These systems are remarkably complex. Their hardwired internal organization enables them to behave as genomic information processing systems. Developmental gene regulatory networks consist of the cis-regulatory systems of all the relevant genes and the regulatory linkages amongst them. Though there is yet little explicit information, some general properties of genomic regulatory networks have become apparent. The key to understanding how genomic regulatory networks are organized, and how they work, lies in experimental analysis of cis-regulatory systems at all levels of the regulatory network.},

abstract = {A confocal laser scanning microscopy method has been developed for the quantitation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter of gene activity in living three-dimensional structures such as sea urchin and starfish embryos. This method is between 2 and 50 times more accurate than conventional confocal microscopy procedures depending on the localization of GFP within an embryo. By using coinjected Texas red dextran as an internal fluorescent standard, the observed GFP intensity is corrected for variations in laser excitation and fluorescence collection efficiency. To relate the recorded image intensity to the number of GFP molecules, the embryos were lysed gently, and a fluorometric analysis of their contents was performed. Confocal laser scanning microscopy data collection from a single sea urchin blastula required less than 2 min, thereby allowing gene expression in dozens of embryos to be monitored in parallel with high spatial and temporal resolution.},

abstract = {We present the current form of a provisional DNA sequence-based regulatory gene network that explains in outline how endomesodermal specification in the sea urchin embryo is controlled. The model of the network is in a continuous process of revision and growth as new genes are added and new experimental results become available; see http://www.its.caltech.edu/~mirsky/endomeso.htm (End-mes Gene Network Update) for the latest version. The network contains over 40 genes at present, many newly uncovered in the course of this work, and most encoding DNA-binding transcriptional regulatory factors. The architecture of the network was approached initially by construction of a logic model that integrated the extensive experimental evidence now available on endomesoderm specification. The internal linkages between genes in the network have been determined functionally, by measurement of the effects of regulatory perturbations on the expression of all relevant genes in the network. Five kinds of perturbation have been applied: (1) use of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides targeted to many of the key regulatory genes in the network; (2) transformation of other regulatory factors into dominant repressors by construction of Engrailed repressor domain fusions; (3) ectopic expression of given regulatory factors, from genetic expression constructs and from injected mRNAs; (4) blockade of the beta-catenin/Tcf pathway by introduction of mRNA encoding the intracellular domain of cadherin; and (5) blockade of the Notch signaling pathway by introduction of mRNA encoding the extracellular domain of the Notch receptor. The network model predicts the cis-regulatory inputs that link each gene into the network. Therefore, its architecture is testable by cis-regulatory analysis. Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Lytechinus variegatus genomic BAC recombinants that include a large number of the genes in the network have been sequenced and annotated. Tests of the cis-regulatory predictions of the model are greatly facilitated by interspecific computational sequence comparison, which affords a rapid identification of likely cis-regulatory elements in advance of experimental analysis. The network specifies genomically encoded regulatory processes between early cleavage and gastrula stages. These control the specification of the micromere lineage and of the initial veg(2) endomesodermal domain; the blastula-stage separation of the central veg(2) mesodermal domain (i.e., the secondary mesenchyme progenitor field) from the peripheral veg(2) endodermal domain; the stabilization of specification state within these domains; and activation of some downstream differentiation genes. Each of the temporal-spatial phases of specification is represented in a subelement of the network model, that treats regulatory events within the relevant embryonic nuclei at particular stages.},

abstract = {Development of the body plan is controlled by large networks of regulatory genes. A gene regulatory network that controls the specification of endoderm and mesoderm in the sea urchin embryo is summarized here. The network was derived from large-scale perturbation analyses, in combination with computational methodologies, genomic data, cis-regulatory analysis, and molecular embryology. The network contains over 40 genes at present, and each node can be directly verified at the DNA sequence level by cis-regulatory analysis. Its architecture reveals specific and general aspects of development, such as how given cells generate their ordained fates in the embryo and why the process moves inexorably forward in developmental time.},

abstract = {The definitive feature of the many thousand cis-regulatory control modules in an animal genome is their information processing capability. These modules are "wired" together in large networks that control major processes such as development; they constitute "genomic computers." Each control module receives multiple inputs in the form of the incident transcription factors which bind to them. The functions they execute upon these inputs can be reduced to basic AND, OR and NOT logic functions, which are also the unit logic functions of electronic computers. Here we consider the operating principles of the genomic computer, the product of evolution, in comparison to those of electronic computers. For example, in the genomic computer intra-machine communication occurs by means of diffusion (of transcription factors), while in electronic computers it occurs by electron transit along pre-organized wires. There follow fundamental differences in design principle in respect to the meaning of time, speed, multiplicity of processors, memory, robustness of computation and hardware and software. The genomic computer controls spatial gene expression in the development of the body plan, and its appearance in remote evolutionary time must be considered to have been a founding requirement for animal grade life.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory networks are the most complex, extensive control systems found in nature. The interaction between biology and evolution has been the subject of great interest in recent years. This book beautifully explains animal evolution in terms of gene regulatory networks and includes 42 full-color descriptive figures. An authoritative and easy to read volume, presenting the biological processes during development (and their regulation) within the framework of evolution. This book is written to explain the idea of gene regulation without the reader needing to have a strong background in developmental biology. Eric Davidson has been instrumental in elucidating this relationship and he is a recognized expert in the field of developmental biology. This unique text supersedes anything currently available in the market.},

abstract = {During gastrulation, germ layers are formed as prospective mesodermal and endodermal cells internalize and come to underlie the ectoderm [1-9]. Despite the pivotal role of gastrulation in animal development, the cellular interactions underlying this process are poorly understood. In zebrafish, mesoderm and endoderm formation requires the Nodal signals Cyclops and Squint and their cofactor One-eyed pinhead (Oep) [10-14]. We found that marginal cells in maternal-zygotic oep (MZoep) mutants do not internalize during gastrulation and acquire neural and tail fates at the expense of head and trunk mesendoderm. The lack of internalization in MZoep embryos and the cell-autonomous requirement for oep in Nodal signaling enabled us to test whether internalization can be achieved by individual cells or whether it depends on interactions within a group of cells. We found that individual MZoep mutant cells transplanted to the margin of wild-type blastula embryos initially internalize with their neighbors but are unable to contribute to the mesendoderm. In the reciprocal experiment, single wild-type cells transplanted to the margin of MZoep mutant embryos autonomously internalize and can express the mesendodermal markers axial/foxA2 and sox17. These results suggest that internalization and mesendoderm formation in zebrafish can be attained autonomously by single cells.},

abstract = {We developed a three-dimensional (3D) cell model of a multicellular aggregate consisting of several polyhedral cells to investigate the deformation and rearrangement of cells under the influence of external forces. The polyhedral cells fill the space in the aggregate without gaps or overlaps, consist of contracting interfaces and maintain their volumes. The interfaces and volumes were expressed by 3D vertex coordinates. Vertex movements obey equations of motion that rearrange the cells to minimize total free energy, and undergo an elementary process that exchanges vertex pair connections when vertices approach each other. The total free energy includes the interface energy of cells and the compression or expansion energy of cells. Computer simulations provided the following results: An aggregate of cells becomes spherical to minimize individual cell surface areas; Polygonal interfaces of cells remain flat; Cells within the 3D cell aggregate can move and rearrange despite the absence of free space. We examined cell rearrangement to elucidate the viscoelastic properties of the aggregate, e.g. when an external force flattens a cell aggregate (e.g. under centrifugation) its component cells quickly flatten. Under a continuous external force, the cells slowly rearrange to recover their original shape although the cell aggregate remains flat. The deformation and rearrangement of individual cells is a two-step process with a time lag. Our results showed that morphological and viscoelastic properties of the cell aggregate with long relaxation time are based on component cells where minimization of interfacial energy of cells provides a motive force for cell movement.},

abstract = {The correlation between cell shape elongation and the orientation of the division axis described by early cell biologists is still used as a paradigm in developmental studies. However, analysis of early embryo development and tissue morphogenesis has highlighted the role of the spatial distribution of cortical cues able to guide spindle orientation. In vitro studies of cell division have revealed similar mechanisms. Recent data support the possibility that the orientation of cell division in mammalian cells is dominated by cell adhesion and the associated traction forces developed in interphase. Cell shape is a manifestation of these adhesive and tensional patterns. These patterns control the spatial distribution of cortical signals and thereby guide spindle orientation and daughter cell positioning. From these data, cell division appears to be a continuous transformation ensuring the maintenance of tissue mechanical integrity.},

In a search for tyrosine kinases expressed in early zebrafish embryos, a model system for the study of vertebrate development, we discovered Jak1 kinase to be maternally encoded and the mRNA evenly distributed among the cells of blastula-stage embryos. Injection of RNA-encoding dominant-negative Jak1 kinases reduces a specific cell migration, epiboly, and results in the reduction of goosecoid expression and of anterior structures. This work establishes that, in addition to its role in signal transduction of cytokines in adult tissues, Jak1 kinase has a role in early vertebrate development.},

We observed cells in elongating mammary ducts reorganize into a multilayered epithelium, migrate collectively, and rearrange dynamically, all without forming leading cellular extensions. Duct initiation required proliferation, Rac, and myosin light-chain kinase, whereas repolarization to a bilayer depended on Rho kinase. We observed that branching morphogenesis results from the active motility of both luminal and myoepithelial cells. Luminal epithelial cells advanced collectively, whereas myoepithelial cells appeared to restrain elongating ducts. Significantly, we observed that normal epithelium and neoplastic hyperplasias are organized similarly, suggesting common mechanisms of epithelial growth.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Integrin recognition of fibronectin is required for normal gastrulation including the mediolateral cell intercalation behaviors that drive convergent extension and the elongation of the frog dorsal axis; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved are unclear. RESULTS: We report that depletion of fibronectin with antisense morpholinos blocks both convergent extension and mediolateral protrusive behaviors in explant preparations. Both chronic depletion of fibronectin and acute disruptions of integrin alpha5beta1 binding to fibronectin increases the frequency and randomizes the orientation of polarized cellular protrusions, suggesting that integrin-fibronectin interactions normally repress frequent random protrusions in favor of fewer mediolaterally oriented ones. In the absence of integrin alpha5beta1 binding to fibronectin, convergence movements still occur but result in convergent thickening instead of convergent extension. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a role for integrin signaling in regulating the protrusive activity that drives axial extension. We hypothesize that the planar spatial arrangement of the fibrillar fibronectin matrix, which delineates tissue compartments within the embryo, is critical for promoting productive oriented protrusions in intercalating cells.},

abstract = {In vertebrates the endoderm germ layer gives rise to most tissues of the digestive tract and controls head and heart morphogenesis. The induction of endoderm development relies on extracellular signals related to Nodals and propagated intracellularly by TGFbeta type I receptors ALK4/Taram-A. It is unclear, however, whether Nodal/ALK4/Taram-A signalling is involved only in the specification of endodermal precursors or plays a more comprehensive role in the activation of the endodermal program leading to the irreversible commitment of cells to the endodermal fate. Using cell transplantation experiments in zebrafish, we show that marginal cells become committed to endoderm at the onset of gastrulation and that commitment to endoderm can be reached by intracellular activation of the Nodal pathway induced by expression of an activated form of the taram-A receptor, Tar*. In a manner similar to endoderm progenitors, Tar*-activated blastomeres translocate from their initial site of implantation in the blastoderm to reach the surface of their migration substratum, the yolk syncitial layer, where they join endogenous endodermal derivatives during gastrulation and differentiate according to their anteroposterior position. We demonstrate that Nodal/Tar*-induced commitment does not rely on a secondary signal released by Tar*-expressing cells or a signal released by endogenous endoderm since Tar*-expressing wild-type cells can restore endoderm derivatives when transplanted into the endoderm-deficient mutant casanova. Likewise, the YSL does not appear essential for the maintenance of endodermal identity during gastrulation once the Nodal pathway has been activated. Thus, our results demonstrate that the activation of Nodal signalling is sufficient to commit cells both to an endodermal fate and behaviour. Wild-type endoderm implantation into casanova embryos rescues, in a non-autonomous fashion, the defective fusion of the two heart primordia in the midline, highlighting the importance of endoderm for normal heart morphogenesis.},

In contrast, the contributions of cytoskeletal rearrangements and both intercellular and cell-substrate attachments have been the focus of many studies. Here, we review work from many developmental systems that highlights the importance of polarized membrane growth and suggests a general model for the role of endocytic recycling during cell morphogenesis. We also address how the spatio-temporal control of membrane insertion during development can account for various classes of tissue rearrangements. We suggest that tubulogenesis, tissue spreading and cell intercalation stem mostly from a remarkably small number of cell intrinsic surface remodelling events that confer on cells different modes of migratory behaviours.},

Here we detail the major cell movements that occur during zebrafish gastrulation: epiboly, internalization, and convergent extension. Although gastrulation is known to be regulated by signaling pathways such as the Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway, many questions remain about the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Key factors that may play a role in gastrulation cell movements are cell adhesion and cytoskeletal rearrangement. In addition, some of the driving force for gastrulation may derive from tissue interactions such as those described between the enveloping layer and the yolk syncytial layer. Future exploration of gastrulation mechanisms relies on the development of sensitive and quantitative techniques to characterize embryonic germ-layer properties.},

abstract = {This article suggests that apparent disagreements between the concept of developmental constraints and neo-Darwinian views on morphological evolution can disappear by using a different conceptualization of the interplay between development and selection. A theoretical framework based on current evolutionary and developmental biology and the concepts of variational properties, developmental patterns and developmental mechanisms is presented. In contrast with existing paradigms, the approach in this article is specifically developed to compare developmental mechanisms by the morphological variation they produce and the way in which their functioning can change due to genetic variation. A developmental mechanism is a gene network, which is able to produce patterns in space though the regulation of some cell behaviour (like signalling, mitosis, apoptosis, adhesion, etc.). The variational properties of a developmental mechanism are all the pattern transformations produced under different initial and environmental conditions or IS-mutations. IS-mutations are DNA changes that affect how two genes in a network interact, while T-mutations are mutations that affect the topology of the network itself. This article explains how this new framework allows predictions not only about how pattern formation affects variation, and thus phenotypic evolution, but also about how development evolves by replacement between pattern formation mechanisms. This article presents testable inferences about the evolution of the structure of development and the phenotype under different selective pressures. That is what kind of pattern formation mechanisms, in which relative temporal order, and which kind of phenotypic changes, are expected to be found in development.},

abstract = {Simulations of biological evolution, in which computers are used to evolve systems toward a goal, often require many generations to achieve even simple goals. It is therefore of interest to look for generic ways, compatible with natural conditions, in which evolution in simulations can be speeded. Here, we study the impact of temporally varying goals on the speed of evolution, defined as the number of generations needed for an initially random population to achieve a given goal. Using computer simulations, we find that evolution toward goals that change over time can, in certain cases, dramatically speed up evolution compared with evolution toward a fixed goal. The highest speedup is found under modularly varying goals, in which goals change over time such that each new goal shares some of the subproblems with the previous goal. The speedup increases with the complexity of the goal: the harder the problem, the larger the speedup. Modularly varying goals seem to push populations away from local fitness maxima, and guide them toward evolvable and modular solutions. This study suggests that varying environments might significantly contribute to the speed of natural evolution. In addition, it suggests a way to accelerate optimization algorithms and improve evolutionary approaches in engineering.},

abstract = {Recent studies show that cell dispersal is a widespread phenomenon in the development of early vertebrate embryos. These cell movements coincide with major decisions for the spatial organization of the embryo, and they parallel genetic patterning events. For example, in the central nervous system, cell dispersal is first mainly anterior-posterior and subsequently dorsal-ventral. Thus, genes expressed in signaling centers of the embryo probably control cell movements, tightly linking cellular and genetic patterning. Cell dispersal might be important for the correct positioning of cells and tissues involved in intercellular signaling. The emergence of cell dispersal at the onset of vertebrate evolution indicates a shift from early, lineage-based cellular patterning in small embryos to late, movement-based cellular patterning of polyclones in large embryos. The conservation of the same basic body plan by invertebrate and vertebrate chordates suggests that evolution of the embryonic period preceding the phylotypic stage was by intercalary co-option of basic cell activities present in the ancestral metazoan cell.},

abstract = {The molecular and cellular mechanisms governing cell motility and directed migration in response to the chemokine SDF-1 are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that zebrafish primordial germ cells whose migration is guided by SDF-1 generate bleb-like protrusions that are powered by cytoplasmic flow. Protrusions are formed at sites of higher levels of free calcium where activation of myosin contraction occurs. Separation of the acto-myosin cortex from the plasma membrane at these sites is followed by a flow of cytoplasm into the forming bleb. We propose that polarized activation of the receptor CXCR4 leads to a rise in free calcium that in turn activates myosin contraction in the part of the cell responding to higher levels of the ligand SDF-1. The biased formation of new protrusions in a particular region of the cell in response to SDF-1 defines the leading edge and the direction of cell migration.},

abstract = {This chapter focuses on the in vivo macroassembly dynamics of fibronectin and fibrillin-2--two prominent extracellular matrix (ECM) components, present in vertebrate embryos at the earliest stages of development. The ECM is an inherently dynamic structure with a well-defined position fate: ECM filaments are not only anchored to and move with established tissue boundaries, but are repositioned prior to the formation of new anatomical features. We distinguish two ECM filament relocation processes-each operating on different length scales. First, ECM filaments are moved by large-scale tissue motion, which rearranges major organ primordia within the embryo. The second type of motion, on the scale of the individual ECM filaments, is driven by local motility and protrusive activity of nearby cells. The motion decomposition is made practically possible by recent advances in microscopy and high-resolution particle image velocimetry algorithms. We demonstrate that both kinds of motion contribute substantially to the establishment of normal ECM structure, and both must be taken into account when attempting to understand ECM macroassembly during embryonic morphogenesis. The tissue-scale motion changes the local amount (density) and the tissue-level structure (e.g., orientation) of ECM fibers. Local reorganization includes filament assembly and the segregation of ECM into specific patterns. Local reorganization takes place most actively at Hensen's node and around the primitive streak. These regions are also sites of active cell migration, where fibrillin-2 and fibronectin are often colocalized in ECM globules, and new fibrillin-2 foci are deposited. During filament assembly, the globular patches of ECM are joined into larger linear structures in a hierarchical process: increasingly larger structures are created by the aggregation of smaller units. A future understanding of ECM assembly thus requires the study of the complex interactions between biochemical assembly steps, local cell action, and tissue motion.},

abstract = {Development of the animal body plan is controlled by large gene regulatory networks (GRNs), and hence evolution of body plans must depend upon change in the architecture of developmental GRNs. However, these networks are composed of diverse components that evolve at different rates and in different ways. Because of the hierarchical organization of developmental GRNs, some kinds of change affect terminal properties of the body plan such as occur in speciation, whereas others affect major aspects of body plan morphology. A notable feature of the paleontological record of animal evolution is the establishment by the Early "Cambrian of virtually all phylum-level body plans. We identify a class of GRN component, the kernels" of the network, which, because of their developmental role and their particular internal structure, are most impervious to change. Conservation of phyletic body plans may have been due to the retention since pre-Cambrian time of GRN kernels, which underlie development of major body parts.},

abstract = {In zebrafish (Danio rerio), meroblastic cleavages generate an embryo in which blastomeres cover the animal pole of a large yolk cell. At the 500-1000 cell stage, the marginal blastomeres fuse with the yolk cell forming the yolk syncytial layer. During epiboly the blastoderm and the yolk syncytial layer spread toward the vegetal pole. We have studied developmental changes in organization and function during epiboly of two distinct microtubule arrays located in the cortical cytoplasm of the yolk cell. In the anuclear yolk cytoplasmic layer, an array of microtubules extends along the animal-vegetal axis to the vegetal pole. In the early blastula the yolk cytoplasmic layer microtubules appear to originate from the marginal blastomeres. Once formed, the yolk syncytial layer exhibits its own network of intercrossing mitotic or interphase microtubules. The microtubules of the yolk cytoplasmic layer emanate from the microtubule network of the syncytial layer. At the onset of epiboly, the external yolk syncytial layer narrows, the syncytial nuclei become tightly packed and the network of intercrossing microtubules surrounding them becomes denser. Soon after, there is a vegetal expansion of the blastoderm and of the yolk syncytial layer with its network of intercrossing microtubules. Concomitantly, the yolk cytoplasmic layer diminishes and its set of animal-vegetal microtubules becomes shorter. We investigated the involvement of microtubules in epiboly using the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole and a stabilizing agent taxol. In embryos treated with nocodazole, microtubules were absent and epibolic movements of the yolk syncytial nuclei were blocked. In contrast, the vegetal expansion of the enveloping layer and deep cells was only partially inhibited. The process of endocytosis, proposed to play a major role in epiboly of the yolk syncytial layer (Betchaku, T. and Trinkaus, J. P. (1986) Am. Zool. 26, 193-199), was still observed in nocodazole-treated embryos. Treatment of embryos with taxol led to a delay in all epibolic movements. We propose that the yolk cell microtubules contribute either directly or indirectly to all epibolic movements. However, the epibolic movements of the yolk syncytial layer nuclei and of the blastoderm are not coupled, and only movements of the yolk syncytial nuclei are absolutely dependent on microtubules. We hypothesize that the microtubule network of the syncytial layer and the animal-vegetal set of the yolk cytoplasmic layer contribute differently to various aspects of epiboly. Models that address the mechanisms by which the two microtubule arrays might function during epiboly are discussed.},

abstract = {The noncanonical wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway [1] regulates the mediolaterally (planarly) polarized cell protrusive activity and intercalation that drives the convergent extension movements of vertebrate gastrulation [2], yet the underlying mechanism is unknown. We report that perturbing expression of Xenopus PCP genes, Strabismus (Xstbm), Frizzled (Xfz7), and Prickle (Xpk), disrupts radially polarized fibronectin fibril assembly on mesodermal tissue surfaces, mediolaterally polarized motility, and intercalation. Polarized motility is restored in Xpk-perturbed explants but not in Xstbm- or Xfz7-perturbed explants cultured on fibronectin surfaces. The PCP complex, including Xpk, first regulates polarized surface assembly of the fibronectin matrix, which is necessary for mediolaterally polarized motility, and then, without Xpk, has an additional and necessary function in polarizing motility. These results show that the PCP complex regulates several cell polarities (radial, planar) and several processes (matrix deposition, motility), by indirect and direct mechanisms, and acts in several modes, either with all or a subset of its components, during vertebrate morphogenesis.},

Gastrulation, therefore, provides a unique developmental system in which to study cell movements in vivo in a fairly simple cellular context. Recent advances have been made in elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie cell movements during zebrafish gastrulation. These findings can be compared with observations made in other model systems to identify potential general mechanisms of cell migration during development.},

Differential migratory behavior within the heart field was observed, resulting in a rotation of the heart tube. The leftward displacement and rotation of the tube requires hyaluronan synthase 2 expression within the CPCs. Furthermore, by reducing or ectopically activating BMP signaling or by implantation of BMP beads we could demonstrate that BMP signaling, which is asymmetrically activated in the lateral plate mesoderm and regulated by early left-right signals, is required to direct CPC migration and cardiac rotation. Together, these results support a model in which CPCs migrate toward a BMP source during development of the linear heart tube, providing a mechanism by which the left-right axis drives asymmetric development of the vertebrate heart.},

abstract = {Beginning during the late blastula stage in zebrafish, cells located beneath a surface epithelial layer of the blastoderm undergo rearrangements that accompany major changes in shape of the embryo. We describe three distinctive kinds of cell rearrangements. (1) Radial cell intercalations during epiboly mix cells located deeply in the blastoderm among more superficial ones. These rearrangements thoroughly stir the positions of deep cells, as the blastoderm thins and spreads across the yolk cell. (2) Involution at or near the blastoderm margin occurs during gastrulation. This movement folds the blastoderm into two cellular layers, the epiblast and hypoblast, within a ring (the germ ring) around its entire circumference. Involuting cells move anteriorwards in the hypoblast relative to cells that remain in the epiblast; the movement shears the positions of cells that were neighbors before gastrulation. Involuting cells eventually form endoderm and mesoderm, in an anterior-posterior sequence according to the time of involution. The epiblast is equivalent to embryonic ectoderm. (3) Mediolateral cell intercalations in both the epiblast and hypoblast mediate convergence and extension movements towards the dorsal side of the gastrula. By this rearrangement, cells that were initially neighboring one another become dispersed along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Epiboly, involution and convergent extension in zebrafish involve the same kinds of cellular rearrangements as in amphibians, and they occur during comparable stages of embryogenesis.},

abstract = {The movement of cells that maintain cell-cell junctions yet protrude along or within tissues is an important mechanism for cell positioning in morphogenesis, tissue repair and cancer. Collective cell migration shares similarities but also important differences to individually migrating cells. Coherent groups of cells are arranged and held together by cell-cell adhesion molecules, including cadherins, integrins, ALCAM and NCAM. Integrins of the beta 1 and beta 3 families further provide polarized interactions with the extracellular tissue environment, while matrix-degrading proteases become focalized to substrate contacts to widen tissue space for the advancing cell mass. By generating one functional unit, in contrast to individual cell migration, collective migration provides the active and passive translocation of mobile and non-mobile cells, respectively. This review highlights cellular and molecular principles of collective migration in the context of morphogenic tissue patterning and tumor cell invasion.},

The analysis of cultured cells has led to an explosion in our understanding of the molecules that trigger growth and mediate cell-cycle progression. However, the mechanism by which the local growth differentials that drive morphogenesis are established and maintained still remains unknown. Here we review recent work that reveals the importance of cell binding to the extracellular matrix, and associated changes in cell shape and cytoskeletal tension, to the spatial control of cell-cycle progression. These findings change the paradigm of cell-growth control, by placing our understanding of molecular signalling cascades in the context of the structural and mechanical complexity of living tissues.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates that involution does not occur during early gastrulation of Fundulus heteroclitus, prior to and during germ ring formation. This conclusion has been reached by following the motile behavior of large numbers of individual cells. Instead of involution, superficial deep cells of the marginal region of the blastoderm undergo ingression. They do not leave the surface as members of a flowing cohesive sheet, but sink beneath rather haphazardly as individuals. Indeed, during much of ingression, many marginal cells are so loosely arranged that they move about freely on the yolk syncytial layer. A small proportion of the cells initially at the blastoderm margin undergo ingression there, but most recede from the margin and ingress supramarginally one to three cell diameters from the margin. Cells that are initially supramarginal ingress mainly there, sometimes quite far from the margin. Only a small number moves to the margin and ingresses there. Interestingly, although most ingression takes place supramarginally, much occurs close to the margin-up to one to four cells away. Ingression begins immediately after the onset of epiboly and is most active before appearance of the germ ring; it ceases quite soon thereafter. It is also more active dorsally than ventrally, correlating with the earlier formation of the germ ring dorsally. Ingression constitutes the first invasive cellular activity of development. Significantly, it proceeds by blebbing locomotion, a noncontact inhibiting mode of cell movement. The possible broader import of these discoveries is given appropriate attention.},

abstract = {Oriented cell division is an integral part of pattern development in processes ranging from asymmetric segregation of cell-fate determinants to the shaping of tissues. Despite proposals that it has an important function in tissue elongation, the mechanisms regulating division orientation have been little studied outside of the invertebrates Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we have analysed mitotic divisions during zebrafish gastrulation using in vivo confocal imaging and found that cells in dorsal tissues preferentially divide along the animal-vegetal axis of the embryo. Establishment of this animal-vegetal polarity requires the Wnt pathway components Silberblick/Wnt11, Dishevelled and Strabismus. Our findings demonstrate an important role for non-canonical Wnt signalling in oriented cell division during zebrafish gastrulation, and indicate that oriented cell division is a driving force for axis elongation. Furthermore, we propose that non-canonical Wnt signalling has a conserved role in vertebrate axis elongation, orienting both cell intercalation and mitotic division.},

abstract = {Directed cell migration is critical for tissue morphogenesis and wound healing, but the mechanism of directional control is poorly understood. Here we show that the direction in which cells extend their leading edge can be controlled by constraining cell shape using micrometer-sized extracellular matrix (ECM) islands. When cultured on square ECM islands in the presence of motility factors, cells preferentially extended lamellipodia, filopodia, and microspikes from their corners. Square cells reoriented their stress fibers and focal adhesions so that tractional forces were concentrated in these corner regions. When cell tension was dissipated, lamellipodia extension ceased. Mechanical interactions between cells and ECM that modulate cytoskeletal tension may therefore play a key role in the control of directional cell motility.},

abstract = {The neo-Darwinian paradigm benefits from the assumption that phenotypic variation is gradual and that phenotype and genotype have a relatively simple relationship. These assumptions are historically inherited from the times of the neo-Darwinian synthesis and, consequently, do not include present understanding about development. In this study, understanding about the dynamics of pattern formation is used to explore to that extent phenotypic variation can be expected to be gradual and simply related to molecular variation. Variation in simple phenotypes seems to fit neo-Darwinian assumptions but variation in complex phenotypes does not. Instead, variation in complex phenotypes would have a tendency to relatively less gradual evolution, even at microevolutionary time scales, that would make phylogenetic reconstructions more difficult. In addition, they will have a tendency to exhibit specific trends in innovation rates over group radiations with early accelerations and late decelerations. This work also explores further consequences of these results in our understanding of phenotypic evolution.},

To investigate the role of PDGF signalling during this process, we have generated a novel point mutant of PDGF receptor-alpha analogous to the W37 mutation of c-kit. This molecule is a specific, potent, dominant inhibitor of PDGF signalling in vivo. Injection of RNA encoding this protein into Xenopus embryos prevents closure of the blastopore, leads to abnormal gastrulation and a loss of anterior structures. Convergent extension is not inhibited in these embryos, but rather, involuting mesodermal cells fail to adhere to the overlying ectoderm. PDGF may therefore be required for mesodermal cell-substratum interaction.},

abstract = {Rapid and sequential cell shape changes take place during the formation of the ventral furrow (VF) at the beginning of Drosophila gastrulation. At the cellular level, this morphogenetic event demands close coordination of the proteins involved in actin cytoskeletal reorganization. In order to construct a regulatory network that describes these cell shape changes, we have used published genetic and molecular data for 18 genes encoding transcriptional regulators and signaling pathway components. Based on the dynamic behavior of this network we explored the hypothesis that the combination of three recognizable phenotypes describing wild type or mutant cell types, during VF invagination, correspond to different activation states of a specific set of these gene products, which are point attractors of the regulatory network. From our results, we recognize missing components in the regulatory network and suggest alternative pathways in the regulation of cell shape changes during VF formation.},

abstract = {Rho GTPases are molecular switches that regulate many essential cellular processes, including actin dynamics, cell adhesion, cell-cycle progression, and transcription. We have isolated the Xenopus homolog of Rho GTPase Cdc42 and examined its potential role during gastrulation movements in early Xenopus embryos. XCdc42 is expressed in tissues undergoing extensive morphogenetic changes, such as the deep layers of involuting mesoderm and posterior neuroectoderm during gastrulation, and somitic mesoderm at neurula stages. Overexpression of either wild-type (WT) or dominant-negative (DN) XCdc42 interferes with convergent extension movements in intact embryos, activin-stimulated animal caps, and dorsal marginal zone explants. These effects occur without affecting mesodermal specification. Overexpression of WT or DN XCdc42 leads to the decrease and increase of cell adhesiveness of blastomeres, respectively, as demonstrated by the cell adhesion assay. In addition, when overexpressed, PKC-alpha, XWnt-5a, and Mfz-3 inhibit activin-induced convergent extension in animal cap explants. This inhibition can be rescued by coexpression of DN XCdc42, implying that XCdc42 acts downstream of the Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway involving PKC activation. XCdc42 also lies downstream of XWnt-5a in the regulation of Ca2+-dependent cell adhesion. Taken together, our results suggest that XCdc42 plays a role in the regulation of convergent extension movements during gastrulation through the protein kinase C-mediated Wnt/Ca2+ pathway.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The small GTPases Rac and Rho act as cellular switches in many important biological processes. In the fruit fly Drosophila, RhoA participates in the establishment of planar polarity, a process mediated by the receptor Frizzled (Fz). Thus far, analysis of Rac in this process has not been possible because of the absence of mutant Rac alleles. Here, we have investigated the role of Rac and Rho in establishing the polarity of ommatidia in the Drosophila eye. RESULTS: By expressing a dominant negative or a constitutively activated form of Rac1, we interfered specifically with Rac signaling and disrupted ommatidial polarity. The resulting defects were similar to the loss/gain-of-function phenotypes typical of tissue-polarity genes. Through genetic interaction and rescue experiments involving a polarity-specific, loss-of-function dishevelled (dsh) allele, we found that Rac1 acts downstream of Dsh in the Fz signaling pathway, but upstream of, or in parallel to, RhoA. Rac signaled to the nucleus through the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade in this process. By generating point mutations in the effector loop of RhoA, we found that RhoA also signals to the nucleus during the establishment of ommatidial polarity. Nevertheless, Rac and RhoA activated transcription of distinct target genes. CONCLUSIONS: Rac is specifically required downstream of Dsh in the Fz pathway. It functions upstream or in parallel to RhoA and both signal to the nucleus, through distinct effectors, to establish planar polarity in the Drosophila eye.},

abstract = {Generation of morphological diversity remains a challenge for evolutionary biologists because it is unclear how an ultimately finite number of genes involved in initial pattern formation integrates with morphogenesis. Ideally, models used to search for the simplest developmental principles on how genes produce form should account for both developmental process and evolutionary change. Here we present a model reproducing the morphology of mammalian teeth by integrating experimental data on gene interactions and growth into a morphodynamic mechanism in which developing morphology has a causal role in patterning. The model predicts the course of tooth-shape development in different mammalian species and also reproduces key transitions in evolution. Furthermore, we reproduce the known expression patterns of several genes involved in tooth development and their dynamics over developmental time. Large morphological effects frequently can be achieved by small changes, according to this model, and similar morphologies can be produced by different changes. This finding may be consistent with why predicting the morphological outcomes of molecular experiments is challenging. Nevertheless, models incorporating morphology and gene activity show promise for linking genotypes to phenotypes.},

In this study, soft tissues and tissue-like phantoms were modeled as isotropic, viscoelastic, and nearly incompressible media. A 3D incompressible mixed u-p element of eight nodes, S1P0, was developed to accurately calculate the stiffness matrix for soft tissues. The finite element equations of motion were solved using the Newmark method. The Voigt description for tissue viscosity was applied to estimate the relative viscous coefficient from the phase shift between the response and excitation in a harmonic case. After validating our model via ANSYS simulation and experiments, a MATLAB finite element program was then employed to explore the effect of excitation location, viscosity, and multiple frequencies on the dynamic displacement at the frequency of interest.},

For some particular geometrical characteristics, the shapes of the vesicles change continuously and randomly on a slow time scale (tens of seconds) and thus exhibit conformal diffusion. This phenomenon is a reflection of the conformal degeneracy of the elastic curvature energy. Its observation sets a limit (three constraints) on the number of physical constraints relevant to the determination of the shapes of vesicles.},

abstract = {Shear rate has been shown to critically affect the kinetics and receptor specificity of cell-cell interactions. In this study, the collision process between two modeled cells interacting in a linear shear flow is numerically investigated. The two identical biological or artificial cells are modeled as deformable capsules composed of an elastic membrane. The cell deformation and trajectories are computed using the immersed boundary method (IBM) for shear rates of 100-400s(-1). As the two cells collide under hydrodynamic shear, large local cell deformations develop. The effective contact area between the two cells is modulated by the shear rate, and reaches a maximum value at intermediate levels of shear. At relatively low shear rate, the contact area is an enclosed region. As the shear rate increases, dimples form on the membrane surface, and the contact region becomes annular. The nonmonotonic increase of the contact area with the increase of shear rate from computational results implies that there is a maximum effective receptor-ligand binding area for cell adhesion. This finding suggests the existence of possible hydrodynamic mechanism that could be used to interpret the observed maximum leukocyte aggregation in shear flow.

abstract = {As physical entities, living cells possess structural and physical properties that enable them to withstand the physiological environment as well as mechanical stimuli occurring within and outside the body. Any deviation from these properties will not only undermine the physical integrity of the cells, but also their biological functions. As such, a quantitative study in single cell mechanics needs to be conducted. In this review, we will examine some mechanical models that have been developed to characterize mechanical responses of living cells when subjected to both transient and dynamic loads. The mechanical models include the cortical shell-liquid core (or liquid drop) models which are widely applied to suspended cells; the solid model which is generally used for adherent cells; the power-law structural damping model which is more suited for studying the dynamic behavior of adherent cells; and finally, the biphasic model which has been widely used to study musculoskeletal cell mechanics. Based upon these models, future attempts can be made to develop even more detailed and accurate mechanical models of living cells once these three factors are adequately addressed: structural heterogeneity, appropriate constitutive relations for each of the distinct subcellular regions and components, and active forces acting within the cell. More realistic mechanical models of living cells can further contribute towards the study of mechanotransduction in cells.},

abstract = {The yolk syncytial layer (YSL) of the teleostean yolk cell is known to play important roles in the induction of cellular mesendoderm, as well as the patterning of dorsal tissues. To determine how this extraembryonic endodermal compartment is subdivided and morphologically transformed during early development, we have examined collective movements of vitally stained YSL nuclei in axiating zebrafish embryos by using four-dimensional confocal microscopy. During blastulation, gastrulation, and early segmentation, zebrafish YSL nuclei display several highly patterned movements, which are organized into spatially distinct morphogenetic domains along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes. During the late blastula period, with the onset of epiboly, nuclei throughout the YSL initiate longitudinal movements that are directed along the animal-vegetal axis. As epiboly progresses, nuclei progressively recede from the advancing margin of the epibolic YSL. However, a small group of nuclei is retained at the YSL margin to form a constricting blastoporal ring. During mid-gastrulation, YSL nuclei undergo convergent-extension behavior toward the dorsal midline, with a subset of nuclei forming an axial domain that underlies the notochord. These highly patterned movements of YSL nuclei share remarkable similarities to the morphogenetic movements of deep cells in the overlying zebrafish blastoderm. The macroscopic shape changes of the zebrafish yolk cell, as well as the morphogenetic movements of its YSL nuclei, are homologous to several morphogenetic behaviors that are regionally expressed within the vegetal endodermal cell mass of gastrulating Xenopus embryos. In contrast to the cellular endoderm of Xenopus, the dynamics of zebrafish YSL show that a syncytial endodermal germ layer can express a temporal sequence of morphogenetic domains without undergoing progressive steps of cell fate restriction.},

abstract = {The Roundabout (Robo) family of receptors and their extracellular ligands, the Slit protein family, play important roles in repulsive axon guidance. First identified in Drosophila, Robo receptors form an evolutionarily conserved sub-family of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that are characterized by the presence of five Ig repeats and three fibronectin-type III repeats in the extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with several conserved motifs that play important roles in Robo-mediated signaling (Cell 92 (1998) 205; Cell 101 (2000) 703). Robo family members have now been identified in C. elegans, Xenopus, rat, mouse, and human (Cell 92 (1998) 205; Cell 92 (1998) 217; Cell 96 (1999) 807; Dev. Biol. 207 (1999) 62). Furthermore, multiple robo genes have been described in Drosophila, rat, mouse and humans, raising the possibility of potential redundancy and diversity in robo gene function. As a first step in elucidating the role of Robo receptors during vertebrate development, we identified and characterized two Robo family members from zebrafish. We named these zebrafish genes robo1 and robo3, reflecting their amino acid sequence similarity to other vertebrate robo genes. Both genes are dynamically expressed in the developing nervous system in distinct patterns. robo3 is expressed during the first day of development in the hindbrain and spinal cord and is later expressed in the tectum and retina. robo1 nervous system expression appears later in development and is more restricted. Moreover, both genes are expressed in non-neuronal tissues consistent with additional roles for these genes during development.},

We report here the identification of a new tissue polarity gene named starry night (stan). Mutations in this essential gene alter the polarity of cuticular structures in all regions of the adult body. The detailed polarity phenotype of stan on the wing suggested that it is most likely a component of the frizzled (fz) pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, stan appears to be downstream of and required for fz function. We molecularly cloned stan and found that it encodes a huge protocadherin containing nine cadherin motifs, four EGF-like motifs, two laminin G motifs, and seven transmembrane domains. This suggests that Stan functions in signal reception, perhaps together with Fz.},

abstract = {Galileo described the concept of motion relativity--motion with respect to a reference frame--in 1632. He noted that a person below deck would be unable to discern whether the boat was moving. Embryologists, while recognizing that embryonic tissues undergo large-scale deformations, have failed to account for relative motion when analyzing cell motility data. A century of scientific articles has advanced the concept that embryonic cells move ("migrate") in an autonomous fashion such that, as time progresses, the cells and their progeny assemble an embryo. In sharp contrast, the motion of the surrounding extracellular matrix scaffold has been largely ignored/overlooked. We developed computational/optical methods that measure the extent embryonic cells move relative to the extracellular matrix. Our time-lapse data show that epiblastic cells largely move in concert with a sub-epiblastic extracellular matrix during stages 2 and 3 in primitive streak quail embryos. In other words, there is little cellular motion relative to the extracellular matrix scaffold--both components move together as a tissue. The extracellular matrix displacements exhibit bilateral vortical motion, convergence to the midline, and extension along the presumptive vertebral axis--all patterns previously attributed solely to cellular "migration." Our time-resolved data pose new challenges for understanding how extracellular chemical (morphogen) gradients, widely hypothesized to guide cellular trajectories at early gastrulation stages, are maintained in this dynamic extracellular environment. We conclude that models describing primitive streak cellular guidance mechanisms must be able to account for sub-epiblastic extracellular matrix displacements.},

abstract = {Wnt signalling plays a crucial role in the control of morphogenetic movements. We describe the expression and functional analyses of frizzled 7 (Xfz7) during gastrulation in Xenopus. Low levels of Xfz7 transcripts are expressed maternally during cleavage stages; its zygotic expression strongly increases at the beginning of gastrulation and is predominantly localized to the presumptive neuroectoderm and deep cells of the involuting mesoderm. Overexpression of Xfz7 in the dorsal equatorial region affects the movements of convergent extension and delays mesodermal involution. It alters the correct localization, but not the expression, of mesodermal and neural markers. These effects can be rescued by extra-Xfz7, which is a secreted form of the receptor that also weakly inhibits convergent extension when overexpressed. This suggests that the wild-type and truncated receptors have opposing effects when coexpressed and that overexpression of Xfz7 causes an increased signalling activity. Consistent with this, Xfz7 biochemically and functionally interacts with Xwnt11. In addition, Dishevelled, but not ({\&}bgr;)-catenin, synergizes with Xfz7 to affect convergent extension. Furthermore, overexpression of Xfz7 and Xwnt11 also affects convergent extension in activin-treated animal caps, and this can be efficiently reversed by coexpression of Cdc42(T17N), a dominant negative mutant of the small GTPase Cdc42 known as a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton. Conversely, Cdc42(G12V), a constitutively active mutant, rescues the effects of extra-Xfz7 on convergent extension in a dose-dependent manner. That both gain-of-function and loss-of-function of both frizzled and dishevelled produce the same phenotype has been well described in Drosophila tissue polarity. Therefore, our results suggest an endogenous role of Xfz7 in the regulation of convergent extension during gastrulation.},

abstract = {Interactions between Nodal/Activin and Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signalling pathways have long been thought to play an important role in mesoderm formation. However, the molecular and cellular processes underlying these interactions have remained elusive. Here, we address the epistatic relationships between Nodal and Fgf pathways during early embryogenesis in zebrafish. First, we find that Fgf signalling is required downstream of Nodal signals for inducing the Nodal co-factor One-eyed-pinhead (Oep). Thus, Fgf is likely to be involved in the amplification and propagation of Nodal signalling during early embryonic stages. This could account for the previously described ability of Fgf to render cells competent to respond to Nodal/Activin signals. In addition, overexpression data shows that Fgf8 and Fgf3 can take part in this process. Second, combining zygotic mutations in ace/fgf8 and oep disrupts mesoderm formation, a phenotype that is not produced by either mutation alone and is consistent with our model of an interdependence of Fgf8 and Nodal pathways through the genetic regulation of the Nodal co-factor Oep and the cell propagation of Nodal signalling. Moreover, mesodermal cell populations are affected differentially by double loss-of-function of Zoep;ace. Most of the dorsal mesoderm undergoes massive cell death by the end of gastrulation, in contrast to either single-mutant phenotype. However, some mesoderm cells are still able to undergo myogenic differentiation in the anterior trunk of Zoep;ace embryos, revealing a morphological transition at the level of somites 6-8. Further decreasing Oep levels by removing maternal oep products aggravates the mesodermal defects in double mutants by disrupting the fate of the entire mesoderm. Together, these results demonstrate synergy between oep and fgf8 that operates with regional differences and is involved in the induction, maintenance, movement and survival of mesodermal cell populations.},

abstract = {The signaling mechanisms that specify, guide and coordinate cell behavior during embryonic morphogenesis are poorly understood. We report that a Xenopus homolog of the Drosophila planar cell polarity gene strabismus (stbm) participates in the regulation of convergent extension, a critical morphogenetic process required for the elongation of dorsal structures in vertebrate embryos. Overexpression of Xstbm, which is expressed broadly in early development and subsequently in the nervous system, causes severely shortened trunk structures; a similar phenotype results from inhibiting Xstbm translation using a morpholino antisense oligo. Experiments with Keller explants further demonstrate that Xstbm can regulate convergent extension in both dorsal mesoderm and neural tissue. The specification of dorsal tissues is not affected. The Xstbm phenotype resembles those obtained with several other molecules with roles in planar polarity signaling, including Dishevelled and Frizzled-7 and -8. Unlike these proteins, however, Stbm has little effect on conventional Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in either frog or fly assays. Thus our results strongly support the emerging hypothesis that a vertebrate analog of the planar polarity pathway governs convergent extension movements.},

Here, we investigate this problem in the developing wing of Drosophila. The surface of the wing is decorated by hexagonally packed hairs that are uniformly oriented by the planar cell polarity pathway. They are constructed by a hexagonal array of wing epithelial cells. Wing epithelial cells are irregularly arranged throughout most of development, but they become hexagonally packed shortly before hair formation. During the process, individual cell boundaries grow and shrink, resulting in local neighbor exchanges, and Cadherin is actively endocytosed and recycled through Rab11 endosomes. Hexagonal packing depends on the activity of the planar cell polarity proteins. We propose that these proteins polarize trafficking of Cadherin-containing exocyst vesicles during junction remodeling. This may be a common mechanism for the action of planar cell polarity proteins in diverse systems.},

abstract = {All insects possess homologous segments, but segment specification differs radically among insect orders. In Drosophila, maternal morphogens control the patterned activation of gap genes, which encode transcriptional regulators that shape the patterned expression of pair-rule genes. This patterning cascade takes place before cellularization. Pair-rule gene products subsequently 'imprint' segment polarity genes with reiterated patterns, thus defining the primordial segments. This mechanism must be greatly modified in insect groups in which many segments emerge only after cellularization. In beetles and parasitic wasps, for instance, pair-rule homologues are expressed in patterns consistent with roles during segmentation, but these patterns emerge within cellular fields. In contrast, although in locusts pair-rule homologues may not control segmentation, some segment polarity genes and their interactions are conserved. Perhaps segmentation is modular, with each module autonomously expressing a characteristic intrinsic behaviour in response to transient stimuli. If so, evolution could rearrange inputs to modules without changing their intrinsic behaviours. Here we suggest, using computer simulations, that the Drosophila segment polarity genes constitute such a module, and that this module is resistant to variations in the kinetic constants that govern its behaviour.},

The chemicals and substrates, in turn, are modeled by a simple artificial chemistry. While the system is designed to allow for the evolution of complex networks, we demonstrate the power of the artificial chemistry by analyzing engineered (handwritten) genomes that lead to the growth of simple networks with behaviors known from physiology. To evolve more complex structures, a Java-based, platform-independent, asynchronous, distributed genetic algorithm (GA) has been implemented that allows users to participate in evolutionary experiments via the World Wide Web.},

Genesis of epithelial planar polarity requires Frizzled, whereas Dfz2 affects morphogenesis by wingless-mediated signaling. Dishevelled is required in both signaling pathways. Here, we use genetic and overexpression assays to show that Dishevelled activates JNK cascades. Rescue analysis reveals different protein domain requirements in Dishevelled for the two pathways; the C-terminal DEP domain is essential to rescue planar polarity defects and induce JNK signaling. Furthermore, the planar polarity-specific dsh1 allele is mutated in the DEP domain. Our results indicate that different Wnt/Fz signals activate distinct intracellular pathways, and Dishevelled discriminates among them by distinct domain interactions.},

abstract = {We present a phenomenological modeling framework for development. Our purpose is to provide a systematic method for discovering and expressing correlations in experimental data on gene expression and other developmental processes. The modeling framework is based on a connectionist or "neural net" dynamics for biochemical regulators, coupled to "grammatical rules" which describe certain features of the birth, growth, and death of cells, synapses and other biological entities. We outline how spatial geometry can be included, although this part of the model is not complete. As an example of the application of our results to a specific biological system, we show in detail how to derive a rigorously testable model of the network of segmentation genes operating in the blastoderm of Drosophila. To further illustrate our methods, we sketch how they could be applied to two other important developmental processes: cell cycle control and cell-cell induction. We also present a simple biochemical model leading to our assumed connectionist dynamics which shows that the dynamics used is at least compatible with known chemical mechanisms.},

abstract = {Laminins are components of basement membranes that are required for morphogenesis, organizing cell adhesions and cell signaling. Studies have suggested that laminins function as alpha(x) beta(y) gamma(z) heterotrimers in vivo. In C. elegans, there is only one laminin beta gene, suggesting that it is required for all laminin functions. Our analysis is consistent with the role of the laminin beta as a subunit of laminin heterotrimers; the same cells express the laminin alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, the laminin beta subunit localizes to all basement membranes throughout development, and secretion of the beta subunit requires an alpha subunit. RNAi inhibition of the beta subunit gene or of the other subunit genes causes an embryonic lethality phenotype. Furthermore, a distinctive set of phenotypes is caused by both viable laminin alpha and beta partial loss-of-function mutations. These results show developmental roles for the laminin beta subunit, and they provide further genetic evidence for the importance of heterotrimer assembly in vivo.},

To assess the role(s) of Flamingo1/Celsr1 (Fmi1) during vertebrate embryogenesis we have exploited the zebrafish system, identifying two Fmi1 orthologues (zFmi1a and zFmi1b) and employing morpholinos to induce mis-splicing of zebrafish fmi1 mRNAs, to both imitate mutations identified in Drosophila flamingo and generate novel aberrant Flamingo proteins. We demonstrate that in the zebrafish gastrula, Fmi1 proteins function in concert with each other and with the vertebrate PCP proteins, Wnt11 and Strabismus, to mediate convergence and extension during gastrulation, without altering early dorso-ventral patterning. We show that zebrafish Fmi1a promotes extension of the entire antero-posterior axis of the zebrafish gastrula including prechordal plate and ventral diencephalic precursors. However, while we show that control over axial extension is autonomous, we find that Fmi1a is not required within lateral cells undergoing dorsal convergence.},

abstract = {We describe mesendoderm morphogenesis during gastrulation in the frog Xenopus laevis and investigate the mechanics of these movements with tissue explants. When a dorsal marginal zone explant is plated onto fibronectin, the mesendoderm moves away from the dorsal axial tissues as an intact sheet. Mesendodermal cells within these explants display monopolar protrusive activity and radially intercalate during explant extension. Live time-lapse confocal sequences of actin dynamics at the margin of these extending explants prompt us to propose that integrin-mediated traction drives these movements. We demonstrate that integrin alpha(5)beta(1) recognition of the synergy site located within the type III(9) repeat of fibronectin is required for mesendoderm extension. Normal mesendoderm morphogenesis occurs with a unique "cup-shaped" geometry of the extending mesendodermal mantle and coincides with a higher rate of tissue extension than that seen in the simpler dorsal marginal zone explant. These higher rates can be reconstituted with "in-the-round" configurations of several explants. We propose several mechanically based hypotheses to explain both the initial fibronectin-dependent extension of the mesendoderm and additional requirement of tissue geometry during the high-velocity closure of the mesendodermal mantle.},

abstract = {Basement membrane matrix is known to induce human endothelial cells to form cord-like structures that mimic those observed during early angiogenesis in vivo. Using this model, blocking antibody studies revealed a major role for the alpha 6 beta 1 integrin in cord formation. During this process, two alterations in the Matrigel structure were observed which suggested a mechanism for the precision of cord formation. First, Matrigel contracted and lifted off an agarose support and second, linear distortions became visible in the Matrigel that correspond to the migration pathways of endothelial cell processes. These pathways, which we have termed "matrix guidance pathways," appear to result from the generation of mechanical tension between endothelial cells. The above data support the concept that endothelial cell guidance during morphogenetic events could be controlled by the ability of these cells to exert mechanical forces on the surrounding extracellular matrix to create pathways for migration.},

In the light of a review detailing the role of these genes in the cell shape changes leading to invagination, and of recent findings showing the expression of twist as mechanically sensitive, we suggest that the expression of twist in the mesoderm could alternatively be maintained by mechanical strains developed during mesoderm invagination.},

Here we utilize a soft-lithography-based, microcontact printing technology in combination with automated computerized image analysis to explore the relationship between ECM geometry and directional motility. When fibroblast cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated adhesive islands with the same area (900 micrometers2) but different geometric forms (square, triangle, pentagon, hexagon, trapezoid, various parallelograms) and aspect ratios, cells preferentially extended new lamellipodia from their corners. In addition, by imposing these simple geometric constraints through ECM, cells were directed to deposit new fibronectin fibrils in these same corner regions. These data indicate that mammalian cells can sense edges within ECM patterns that exhibit a wide range of angularity and that they use these spatial cues to guide where they will deposit ECM and extend new motile processes during the process of directional migration.},

abstract = {The single replacement from milk teeth to permanent teeth makes mammalian teeth different from teeth of most nonmammalian vertebrates and other epithelial organs such as hair and feathers, whose continuous replacement has been linked to Wnt signaling. Here we show that mouse tooth buds expressing stabilized beta-catenin in epithelium give rise to dozens of teeth. The molar crowns, however, are typically simplified unicusped cones. We demonstrate that the supernumerary teeth develop by a renewal process where new signaling centers, the enamel knots, bud off from the existing dental epithelium. The basic aspects of the unlocked tooth renewal can be reproduced with a computer model on tooth development by increasing the intrinsic level of activator production, supporting the role of beta-catenin pathway as an upstream activator of enamel knot formation. These results may implicate Wnt signaling in tooth renewal, a capacity that was all but lost when mammals evolved progressively more complicated tooth shapes.},

abstract = {The maternal genome greatly influences vertebrate embryogenesis before activation of zygotic transcription. Dorsoventral patterning is initiated by maternal factors, but the molecular pathways involved are incompletely understood. In frogs and fish, localized zygotic domains are induced whereby cells either express dorsal or ventral genes. Wnt/beta-catenin signalling promotes expression of the earliest dorsal zygotic genes. Among key zygotic ventralizing factors are the bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps) and the Vent homeodomain family; the latter act as repressors of dorsal organizer gene transcription. Here we show that Runx2, a transcription factor essential for bone formation, is an important maternal determinant of ventral zygotic genes in zebrafish. Depletion of maternal Runx2b type2 strongly dorsalizes embryos, due to loss of the earliest zygotic expression of vox, vent and ved, resulting in expansion of dorsal gene expression. To date, Runx2b is the only known regulator of vox, vent and ved at the onset of zygotic transcription; we show that this regulation is direct. Runx2 transcripts are processed in mature mouse oocytes and we show that murine Runx2 type2 can substitute for the zebrafish orthologue in its ventralizing function, suggesting that Runx2 may have an evolutionarily conserved role in axis formation.},

abstract = {Epithelial morphogenesis depends on coordinated changes in cell shape, a process that is still poorly understood. During zebrafish epiboly and Drosophila dorsal closure, cell-shape changes at the epithelial margin are of critical importance. Here evidence is provided for a conserved mechanism of local actin and myosin 2 recruitment during theses events. It was found that during epiboly of the zebrafish embryo, the movement of the outer epithelium (enveloping layer) over the yolk cell surface involves the constriction of marginal cells. This process depends on the recruitment of actin and myosin 2 within the yolk cytoplasm along the margin of the enveloping layer. Actin and myosin 2 recruitment within the yolk cytoplasm requires the Ste20-like kinase Msn1, an orthologue of Drosophila Misshapen. Similarly, in Drosophila, actin and myosin 2 localization and cell constriction at the margin of the epidermis mediate dorsal closure and are controlled by Misshapen. Thus, this study has characterized a conserved mechanism underlying coordinated cell-shape changes during epithelial morphogenesis.},

abstract = {Understanding the response of tissue structures to mechanical stress is crucial for optimization of mechanical conditioning protocols in the field of heart valve tissue engineering. In heart valve tissue, it is unclear to what extent mechanical loading affects the collagen fibril morphology. To determine if local stress affects the collagen fibril morphology, in terms of fibril diameter, its distribution, and the fibril density, this was investigated in adult native human aortic valve leaflets. Transmission electron microscopy images of collagen fibrils were analyzed at three locations: the commissures, the belly, and the fixed edge of the leaflets. Subsequently, the mechanical behavior of human aortic valves was used in a computational model to predict the stress distribution in the valve leaflet during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. The local stresses at the three locations were related to the collagen fibril morphology. The fibril diameter and density varied significantly between the measured locations, and appeared inversely related. The average fibril diameter increased from the fixed edge, to the belly, and to the commissures of the leaflets, while fibril density decreased. Interestingly, these differences corresponded well with the level of stress at the locations. The presented data showed that large tissue stress is associated with greater average fibril diameter, lower fibril density, and wider fibril size distribution compared with low stress locations in the leaflets. The findings here provide insight in the effect of mechanical loading on the collagen ultrastructure, and are valuable to improve conditioning protocols for tissue engineering.},

Parameters of the model (mainly gene interaction strengths) are optimized in order to fit schematic patterns of expression, drawn from the literature, of genes that are involved in this process of cell fate specification. The model provides suggestions about the role of lateral signalling in neurogenesis and yields specific and testable predictions about the timing and position of appearance of neuroblasts and SOPs within proneural clusters, and about the dynamics of gene expression in individual cells. Experimental testing of these predictions and fits to more accurate quantitative data will help determine which set of model parameters can best describe early neurogenesis.},

abstract = {Loss of fibronectin (FN) from the cell surface has been shown to be closely associated with malignant transformation of cells. To elucidate the role of the FN matrix in the modulation of malignant phenotypes, we overexpressed a full-length cDNA encoding plasma-type FN in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. The cells overexpressing FN adopted a more flattened morphology and deposited a moderately developed FN matrix both in vitro and in vivo, although the level of expression of integrin alpha5beta1 remained unchanged. FN-overexpressing cells exhibited a reduced cell motility on the substratum and grew poorly when injected s.c. into nude mice. Overexpression of FN also suppressed the ability of the tumor cells to proliferate in soft agar, whereas the suppression was reversed by inclusion in soft agar of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing peptide and adhesion-blocking antibodies against the central cell-binding domain of FN. Neither cell motility nor growth potential was altered by overexpression of a truncated form of FN lacking the central cell-binding domain. These results, taken together, indicate that increased deposition of FN in the pericellular matrix per se can suppress the motility and growth potential of tumor cells through interaction with RGD-recognizing integrins, most likely alpha5beta1.},

abstract = {As the zebrafish embryo undergoes gastrulation and epiboly, the cells of the enveloping layer (EVL) expand, covering the entire yolk cell. During the epiboly process, the EVL cells move as a coherent layer, remaining tightly attached to each other and to the underlying yolk syncytial layer (YSL). In view of the central role of the actin cytoskeleton, in both cell motility and cell-cell adhesion, we have labeled these cells in situ with fluorescent phalloidin and anti-actin antibodies. We show that, throughout their migration, the EVL cells retain a conspicuous cortical actin cytoskeletal belt coinciding with cell surface cadherins. At the margins approaching the YSL, the EVL cells extend, from their apicolateral domains, actin-rich filopodial protrusions devoid of detectable cadherin. We have studied the role of the actin cytoskeleton in the maintenance of EVL cohesion during epiboly. Cytochalasin treatment of embryos induces EVL dissociation accompanied by general detachment of the rest of the embryonic cells. In the dissociating EVL cells, the cortical actin belt undergoes fragmentation with the formation of actin aggregates; cadherins, on the other hand, remain evenly distributed at the junctional cell surface. Removal of Ca2+ by ethyleneglycolbis (amino-ethyl-ether)-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) treatment also induces cell dissociation without visible disruption of the cortical actin belt. The protein kinase inhibitor (1-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine dihydrochloride (H-7), which blocks acto-myosin contractility and disrupts actin cables in cultured cells, also potentiates cytochalasin-induced dissociation and promotes the projection of numerous actin-rich lamellipodial extensions. The fact that EVL cells produce microspike-like structures towards the YSL and are capable of lamellipodial activity lend further support to the suggestion (R.W. Keller and J.P. Trinkaus. 1987. Dev. Biol. 120: 12-24) that the EVL cells are not passively mobilized on the expanding YSL but actively participate in epiboly.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors that direct tissue organization during development is one of the most fundamental goals in developmental biology. Various hypotheses explain cell sorting and tissue organization on the basis of the adhesive and mechanical properties of the constituent cells. However, validating these hypotheses has been difficult due to the lack of appropriate tools to measure these parameters. Here we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) to quantify the adhesive and mechanical properties of individual ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm progenitor cells from gastrulating zebrafish embryos. Combining these data with tissue self-assembly in vitro and the sorting behaviour of progenitors in vivo, we have shown that differential actomyosin-dependent cell-cortex tension, regulated by Nodal/TGFbeta-signalling (transforming growth factor beta), constitutes a key factor that directs progenitor-cell sorting. These results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for Nodal-controlled cell-cortex tension in germ-layer organization during gastrulation.},

abstract = {Normal tissue cells are generally not viable when suspended in a fluid and are therefore said to be anchorage dependent. Such cells must adhere to a solid, but a solid can be as rigid as glass or softer than a baby's skin. The behavior of some cells on soft materials is characteristic of important phenotypes; for example, cell growth on soft agar gels is used to identify cancer cells. However, an understanding of how tissue cells-including fibroblasts, myocytes, neurons, and other cell types-sense matrix stiffness is just emerging with quantitative studies of cells adhering to gels (or to other cells) with which elasticity can be tuned to approximate that of tissues. Key roles in molecular pathways are played by adhesion complexes and the actinmyosin cytoskeleton, whose contractile forces are transmitted through transcellular structures. The feedback of local matrix stiffness on cell state likely has important implications for development, differentiation, disease, and regeneration.},

abstract = {Cdc42 and Rac1 are members of the rho family of small guanosinetriphosphatases and are required for a diverse set of cytoskeleton-membrane interactions in different cell types. Here we show that these two proteins contribute differently to the organization of epithelial cells in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. Drac1 is required to assemble actin at adherens junctions. Failure of adherens junction actin assembly in Drac1 dominant-negative mutants is associated with increased cell death. Dcdc42, on the other hand, is required for processes that involve polarized cell shape changes during both pupal and larval development. In the third larval instar, Dcdc42 is required for apico-basal epithelial elongation. Whereas normal wing disc epithelial cells increase in height more than twofold during the third instar, cells that express a dominant-negative version of Dcdc42 remain short and are abnormally shaped. Dcdc42 localizes to both apical and basal regions of the cell during these events, and mediates elongation, at least in part, by effecting a reorganization of the basal actin cytoskeleton. These observations suggest that a common cdc42-based mechanism may govern polarized cell shape changes in a wide variety of cell types.},

abstract = {Fibronectin (FN) forms the primitive fibrillar matrix in both embryos and healing wounds. To study the matrix in living cell cultures, we have constructed a cell line that secretes FN molecules chimeric with green fluorescent protein. These FN-green fluorescent protein molecules were assembled into a typical matrix that was easily visualized by fluorescence over periods of several hours. FN fibrils remained mostly straight, and they were seen to extend and contract to accommodate movements of the cells, indicating that they are elastic. When fibrils were broken or detached from cells, they contracted to less than one-fourth of their extended length, demonstrating that they are highly stretched in the living culture. Previous work from other laboratories has suggested that cryptic sites for FN assembly may be exposed by tension on FN. Our results show directly that FN matrix fibrils are not only under tension but are also highly stretched. This stretched state of FN is an obvious candidate for exposing the cryptic assembly sites.},

The simulations show that these phenomena can be driven by a single equivalent force, namely a surface (or interfacial) tension, that results from cytoskeletal components and cell-cell adhesions. They also reveal that tissue engulfment, cell sorting, and checkerboard-pattern formation involve several discernible mechanical features or stages. With the aid of analytical arguments, we identify the conditions necessary for each of these phenomena. These findings are consistent with previous experimental investigations and computer simulations, but pose significant challenges to current theories of cell sorting and tissue engulfment.},

abstract = {Mutations in the human laminin alpha2 (LAMA2) gene result in the most common form of congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A). There are currently three models for the molecular basis of cellular pathology in MDC1A: (i) lack of LAMA2 leads to sarcolemmal weakness and failure, followed by cellular necrosis, as is the case in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); (ii) loss of LAMA2-mediated signaling during the development and maintenance of muscle tissue results in myoblast proliferation and fusion defects; (iii) loss of LAMA2 from the basement membrane of the Schwann cells surrounding the peripheral nerves results in a lack of motor stimulation, leading to effective denervation atrophy. Here we show that the degenerative muscle phenotype in the zebrafish dystrophic mutant, candyfloss (caf) results from mutations in the laminin alpha2 (lama2) gene. In vivo time-lapse analysis of mechanically loaded fibers and membrane permeability assays suggest that, unlike DMD, fiber detachment is not initially associated with sarcolemmal rupture. Early muscle formation and myoblast fusion are normal, indicating that any deficiency in early Lama2 signaling does not lead to muscle pathology. In addition, innervation by the primary motor neurons is unaffected, and fiber detachment stems from muscle contraction, demonstrating that muscle atrophy through lack of motor neuron activity does not contribute to pathology in this system. Using these and other analyses, we present a model of lama2 function where fiber detachment external to the sarcolemma is mechanically induced, and retracted fibers with uncompromised membranes undergo subsequent apoptosis.},

abstract = {Skeletal muscle morphogenesis transforms short muscle precursor cells into long, multinucleate myotubes that anchor to tendons via the myotendinous junction (MTJ). In vertebrates, a great deal is known about muscle specification as well as how somitic cells, as a cohort, generate the early myotome. However, the cellular mechanisms that generate long muscle fibers from short cells and the molecular factors that limit elongation are unknown. We show that zebrafish fast muscle fiber morphogenesis consists of three discrete phases: short precursor cells, intercalation/elongation, and boundary capture/myotube formation. In the first phase, cells exhibit randomly directed protrusive activity. The second phase, intercalation/elongation, proceeds via a two-step process: protrusion extension and filling. This repetition of protrusion extension and filling continues until both the anterior and posterior ends of the muscle fiber reach the MTJ. Finally, both ends of the muscle fiber anchor to the MTJ (boundary capture) and undergo further morphogenetic changes as they adopt the stereotypical, cylindrical shape of myotubes. We find that the basement membrane protein laminin is required for efficient elongation, proper fiber orientation, and boundary capture. These early muscle defects in the absence of either lamininbeta1 or laminingamma1 contrast with later dystrophic phenotypes in lamininalpha2 mutant embryos, indicating discrete roles for different laminin chains during early muscle development. Surprisingly, genetic mosaic analysis suggests that boundary capture is a cell-autonomous phenomenon. Taken together, our results define three phases of muscle fiber morphogenesis and show that the critical second phase of elongation proceeds by a repetitive process of protrusion extension and protrusion filling. Furthermore, we show that laminin is a novel and critical molecular cue mediating fiber orientation and limiting muscle cell length.},

abstract = {The LAMC1 gene coding for the laminin gamma1 subunit was targeted by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells. Mice heterozygous for the mutation had a normal phenotype and were fertile, whereas homozygous mutant embryos did not survive beyond day 5.5 post coitum. These embryos lacked basement membranes and although the blastocysts had expanded, primitive endoderm cells remained in the inner cell mass, and the parietal yolk sac did not develop. Cultured embryonic stem cells appeared normal after targeting both LAMC1 genes, but the embryoid bodies derived from them also lacked basement membranes, having disorganized extracellular deposits of the basement membrane proteins collagen IV and perlecan, and the cells failed to differentiate into stable myotubes. Secretion of the linking protein nidogen and a truncated laminin alpha1 subunit did occur, but these were not deposited in the extracellular matrix. These results show that the laminin gamma1 subunit is necessary for laminin assembly and that laminin is in turn essential for the organization of other basement membrane components in vivo and in vitro. Surprisingly, basement membranes are not necessary for the formation of the first epithelium to develop during embryogenesis, but first become required for extra embryonic endoderm differentiation.},

abstract = {In multicellular organisms, cells pack together to form tissues of intricate and well defined morphology. How such cell-packing geometries arise is an important open question in biology, because the functionality of many differentiated tissues depends on their reliable formation. We show that combining adhesive forces due to E- and N-cadherin with a quantitative description of cell membrane elasticity in an interfacial energy model explains not only the qualitative neighbor relations, but also the detailed geometry of a tissue. The characteristic cellular geometries in the eyes of both wild-type Drosophila and genetic mutants are accurately reproduced by using a fixed set of few, physically motivated parameters. The model predicts adhesion strengths in the eye epithelium, quantifies their role relative to membrane elasticity, and reveals how simple minimization of interfacial energy can give rise to complex geometric patterns of important biological functionality.},

abstract = {In this article, we show, using a mathematical multiscale model, how cell adhesion may be regulated by interactions between E-cadherin and beta-catenin and how the control of cell adhesion may be related to cell migration, to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and to invasion in populations of eukaryotic cells. E-cadherin mediates cell-cell adhesion and plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of junctional contacts between cells. Loss of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion is a key feature of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. beta-catenin is an intracellular protein associated with the actin cytoskeleton of a cell. E-cadherins bind to beta-catenin to form a complex which can interact both with neighboring cells to form bonds, and with the cytoskeleton of the cell. When cells detach from one another, beta-catenin is released into the cytoplasm, targeted for degradation, and downregulated. In this process there are multiple protein-complexes involved which interact with beta-catenin and E-cadherin. Within a mathematical individual-based multiscale model, we are able to explain experimentally observed patterns solely by a variation of cell-cell adhesive interactions. Implications for cell migration and cancer invasion are also discussed.},

abstract = {Nuclear movements play an essential role in metazoan development. Although the intracellular transport mechanisms underlying nuclear movements have been studied in detail, relatively little is known about signals from surrounding cells and tissues controlling these movements. Here, we show that, in gastrulating zebrafish embryos, convergence movements of nuclei within the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) are guided by mesoderm and endoderm progenitors migrating along the surface of the yolk towards the dorsal side of the developing gastrula. Progenitor cells direct the convergence movements of internal yolk syncytial nuclei (iYSN) by modulating cortical flow within the YSL in which the iYSN are entrained. The effect of mesoderm and endoderm progenitors on the convergence movement of iYSN depends on the expression of E-cadherin, indicating that adhesive contact between the cells and the YSL is required for the mesendoderm-modulated YSL cortical flow mediating nuclear convergence. In summary, our data reveal a crucial function for cortical flow in the coordination of syncytial nuclear movements with surrounding cells and tissues during zebrafish gastrulation.},

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 67, 335-394). While the existence of localized maternal mRNAs has been reported in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, the precise localization patterns of these molecules during oogenesis has not been determined. In this study, in situ hybridization experiments were performed on zebrafish ovaries and activated eggs to examine different mRNA localization patterns. The results establish that while some maternal mRNAs remain ubiquitously distributed throughout the oocyte, other mRNAs follow specific localization patterns, including localization to the animal pole, localization to the vegetal pole, and cortical localization. The animal/vegetal axis is first apparent in stage II oocytes when the earliest mRNA localization is seen. Unique patterns of localization are seen in mature eggs as well. Some mRNAs maintain their oocyte localization patterns, while others localize upon egg activation (fertilization).},

abstract = {Animal tissue and organ development requires the orchestration of cell movements, including those of interconnected cell groups, termed collective cell movements. Such movements are incredibly diverse. Recent work suggests that two core cellular properties, cell-cell adhesion and contractility, can largely determine geometry, packing, sorting, and rearrangement of epithelial cell layers. Two additional force-generating properties, the ability to generate cell protrusions and cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, contribute to active motility. These mechanical properties can be regulated independently in cells, suggesting that they can be employed in a combinatorial manner. A small number of properties used in combination could, in principle, generate a diverse array of cell shapes and arrangements and thus orchestrate the varied morphogenetic events observed during metazoan organ development.},

abstract = {The first signs of cell motility appear in Fundulus toward the end of cleavage, after cleavages 11 and 12. When blastomers cease cleaving, their surfaces undulate and form blebs. At first, these blebbing cell remain in place. Gradually thereafter they begin movement, with blebs and filolamellipodia serving as organs of locomotion. Non-motile cleaving blastomeres have thus differentiated into motile blastula cells. This transformation corresponds to the midblastula transition of amphibian embryos. Gastrulation in Fundulus begins with vegetalward contraction of the external yolk syncytial layer. This causes narrowing of the E-YSL and initiates the epibolic expansion of the blastoderm. Convergent movements of deep cells within the blastoderm begin toward the end of this contraction. The YSL forms as a result of invasion of the yolk cell cytoplasm by nuclei from open marginal blastomers during cleavage. These YSL nuclei then undergo five metachronous divisions. After this, they divide no more. YSL contraction begins approximately 1.5 hours after cessation of these divisions (21-22 degrees C). This cessation of nuclear divisions is preceded by a gradual decrease in rate. (1) The duration of each succeeding mitosis increases steadily and often some nuclei do not divide at mitosis V. (2) The duration of interphases between succeeding mitoses also increases, but to a much greater degree, and the longest interphase by far is the last one, I-IV, between mitoses IV and V. (3) The mitotic waves responsible for mitosis V move much more slowly than those for the first four mitoses and invariably decelerate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Micropipettes were used to bring neutrophils into contact with spherical beads under known forces, and the corresponding contact area was measured over time. The neutrophil was modeled as a viscous liquid drop with a constant cortical tension. Both the equilibrium state and the dynamics of the approach to equilibrium were examined. The equilibrium contact area increased monotonically with force in a manner consistent with a cell cortical tension of 16-24 pN/microm. The dynamic response matched predictions based on a model of the cell as a growing drop using published values for the effective viscosity of the cell. The contact pressure between the cell and substrate at equilibrium is predicted to depend on the curvature of the contacting substrate, but to be independent of the impingement force. The approach to equilibrium was rapid, such that the time-averaged stress for a two-second impingement was within 20% of the equilibrium value. These results have implications for the role of mechanical force in the formation of adhesive contacts.},

The method uses transcriptional perturbations to model the functional interactions between genes as a system of first-order ordinary differential equations. The resulting network model correctly identified the known interactions of key regulators in a 10-gene network from the Snf1 signaling pathway, which is required for expression of glucose-repressed genes upon calorie restriction. The majority of interactions predicted by the network model were confirmed using promoter-reporter gene fusions in gene-deletion mutants and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, revealing a more complex network architecture than previously appreciated. The reverse-engineered network model also predicted an unexpected role for transcriptional regulation of the SNF1 gene by hexose kinase enzyme/transcriptional repressor Hxk2, Mediator subunit Med8, and transcriptional repressor Mig1. These interactions were validated experimentally and used to design new experiments demonstrating Snf1 and its transcriptional regulators Hxk2 and Mig1 as modulators of chronological lifespan. This work demonstrates the value of using network inference methods to identify and characterize the regulators of complex phenotypes, such as aging.},

abstract = {Simple epithelial tissues are organized as single layers of tightly packed cells that surround hollow lumens and form selective barriers separating different internal compartments of the body. The maintenance of epithelial structure and its function requires tight coordination and control of all the life processes of epithelial cells via cell-to-cell communication and signaling. These well-balanced cellular systems are, however, quite often disturbed by genetic or environmental cues that may lead to the formation of epithelial tumors (carcinomas). In fact, more than a half of all diagnosed tumors are initiated from epithelial cells. It is, therefore, important to gain a greater understanding of the factors that form and maintain the epithelial structure, as well as the features of the acinar structure that are modified during cancer development as observable in experimental and clinical research. We address these questions using the bio-mechanical model of the developing hollow epithelial acini introduced in Rejniak and Anderson (Bull. Math. Biol. 70:677-712, 2008). Here, we propose several scenarios involving various bio-mechanical interactions between neighboring cells that result in abnormal acinar development. Whenever possible, we compare our computational results with known experimental cases of mutant acini.},

abstract = {Normal hollow epithelial acini are 3-dimensional culture structures that resemble the architecture and functions of normal breast glands and lobules. This experimental model enables in vitro investigations of genotypic and molecular abnormalities associated with epithelial cancers. However, the way in which the acinar structure is formed is not yet completely understood. Gaining more information about consecutive stages of acini development-starting from a single cell that gives rise to a cluster of randomly oriented cells, followed by cell differentiation that leads to a layer of polarised cells enclosing the hollow lumen-will provide insight into the transformations of eukaryotic cells that are necessary for their successful arrangement into an epithelium. In this paper, we introduce a two-dimensional single-cell-based model representing the cross section of a typical acinus. Using this model, we investigate mechanisms that lead to the unpolarised cell growth, cell polarisation, stabilisation of the acinar structure and maintenance of the hollow lumen and discuss the sufficient conditions for each stage of acinar formation. In the follow-up paper (Rejniak and Anderson, A computational study of the development of epithelial acini. II. Necessary conditions for structure and lumen stability), we investigate what morphological changes are observable in the growing acini when some assumptions of this model are relaxed.},

abstract = {Normal development of the mouse embryo requires the presence of both paternal and maternal genomes. This is due to functional differences having their origin in a differential imprinting of parental genomes. Furthermore, several lines of evidence show that the very early interactions between egg cytoplasm and pronuclei may influence the programming of the embryonic genome and modulate the functional inequality of the parental contribution even during preimplantation stages. In this paper, we show that a factor present in ovulated oocytes of the mouse mutant strain DDK and therefore of maternal origin prevents the formation of the blastocyst. This factor, which acts via an interaction with the paternal genome, is present in oocytes as an RNA and is still active in preimplantation embryos. This is the first direct evidence of such a maternal control in the mouse.},

The RNA of the anterior morphogen bicoid is localized to the anterior pole of the embryo, where bicoid protein controls head and thorax development. The RNA of the posterior morphogen nanos is localized to the posterior pole, where nanos protein is required for abdomen formation. Here we show that the nanos 3' untranslated region, like that of the bicoid RNA, is sufficient for RNA localization. We have used the bicoid RNA localization signal to mislocalize nanos, producing embryos with two sources of nanos protein. Such embryos form two abdomens with mirror image symmetry. Embryos with nanos RNA localized only to the anterior have greater nanos gene activity than embryos with nanos RNA localized posteriorly. We propose a role for RNA localization in regulating nanos activity.},

abstract = {Cell migration is an integrated process requiring the continuous coordinated assembly and disassembly of adhesion structures. How cells orchestrate adhesion turnover is only partially understood. We provide evidence for a novel mechanistic insight into focal adhesion (FA) dynamics by demonstrating that integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein 1 (ICAP-1) slows down FA assembly. Live cell imaging, which was performed in both Icap-1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and cells expressing active beta(1) integrin, shows that the integrin high affinity state favored by talin is antagonistically controlled by ICAP-1. This affinity switch results in modulation in the speed of FA assembly and, consequently, of cell spreading and migration. Unexpectedly, the ICAP-1-dependent decrease in integrin affinity allows cell sensing of matrix surface density, suggesting that integrin conformational changes are important in mechanotransduction. Our results clarify the function of ICAP-1 in cell adhesion and highlight the central role it plays in the cell's integrated response to the extracellular microenvironment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps) are required for the specification of ventrolateral cell fates during embryonic dorsoventral patterning and for proper convergence and extension gastrulation movements, but the mechanisms underlying the latter role remained elusive.

RESULTS:Via bead implantations, we show that the Bmp gradient determines the direction of lateral mesodermal cell migration during dorsal convergence in the zebrafish gastrula. This effect is independent of its role during dorsoventral patterning and of noncanonical Wnt signaling. However, it requires Bmp signal transduction through Alk8 and Smad5 to negatively regulate Ca(2+)/Cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesiveness. In vivo, converging mesodermal cells form lamellipodia that attach to adjacent cells. Bmp signaling diminishes the Cadherin-dependent stability of such contact points, thereby abrogating subsequent cell displacement during lamellipodial retraction.

CONCLUSIONS:We propose that the ventral-to-dorsal Bmp gradient has an instructive role to establish a reverse gradient of cell-cell adhesiveness, thereby defining different migratory zones and directing lamellipodia-driven cell migrations during dorsal convergence in lateral regions of the zebrafish gastrula.},

abstract = {The mechanical aspects of embryonic morphogenesis have been widely analysed by numerical simulations of invagination in sea urchins and Drosophila gastrulation. Finite element models, which describe the tissue as a continuous medium, lead to the global invagination morphogenesis observed in vivo. Here we develop a simulation of multicellular embryo invagination that allows access to both cellular and multicellular mechanical behaviours of the embryo. In this model, the tissue is composed of adhesive individual cells, in which shape change dynamics is governed by internal acto-myosin forces and the hydrodynamic flow associated with membrane movements. We investigated the minimal structural and force elements sufficient to phenocopy mesoderm invagination. The minimal structures are cell membranes characterized by an acto-myosin cortical tension and connected by apical and basal junctions and an acto-myosin contractile ring connected to the apical junctions. An increase in the apical-cortical surface tension is the only control parameter change required to phenocopy most known multicellular and cellular shape changes of Drosophila gastrulation. Specifically, behaviours observed in vivo, including apical junction movements at the onset of gastrulation, cell elongation and subsequent shortening during invagination, and the development of a dorso-ventral gradient of thickness of the embryo, are predicted by this model as passive mechanical consequences of the genetically controlled increase in the apical surface tension in invaginating mesoderm cells, thus demonstrating the accurate description of structures at both global and single cell scales.},

This period is characterized by the formation of the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes, the development of the three germ layers, the specification of organ progenitors, and the complex morphogenetic movements of cells. During the past 10 years a combination of genetic, embryological, and molecular analyses has provided detailed insights into the mechanisms underlying this process. Maternal determinants control the expression of transcription factors and the location of signaling centers that pattern the blastula and gastrula. Bmp, Nodal, FGF, canonical Wnt, and retinoic acid signals generate positional information that leads to the restricted expression of transcription factors that control cell type specification. Noncanonical Wnt signaling is required for the morphogenetic movements during gastrulation. We review how the coordinated interplay of these molecules determines the fate and movement of embryonic cells.},

abstract = {Apical constriction facilitates epithelial sheet bending and invagination during morphogenesis. Apical constriction is conventionally thought to be driven by the continuous purse-string-like contraction of a circumferential actin and non-muscle myosin-II (myosin) belt underlying adherens junctions. However, it is unclear whether other force-generating mechanisms can drive this process. Here we show, with the use of real-time imaging and quantitative image analysis of Drosophila gastrulation, that the apical constriction of ventral furrow cells is pulsed. Repeated constrictions, which are asynchronous between neighbouring cells, are interrupted by pauses in which the constricted state of the cell apex is maintained. In contrast to the purse-string model, constriction pulses are powered by actin-myosin network contractions that occur at the medial apical cortex and pull discrete adherens junction sites inwards. The transcription factors Twist and Snail differentially regulate pulsed constriction. Expression of snail initiates actin-myosin network contractions, whereas expression of twist stabilizes the constricted state of the cell apex. Our results suggest a new model for apical constriction in which a cortical actin-myosin cytoskeleton functions as a developmentally controlled subcellular ratchet to reduce apical area incrementally.},

abstract = {This study provides direct functional evidence that differential adhesion, measurable as quantitative differences in tissue surface tension, influences spatial positioning between zebrafish germ layer tissues. We show that embryonic ectodermal and mesendodermal tissues generated by mRNA-overexpression behave on long-time scales like immiscible fluids. When mixed in hanging drop culture, their cells segregate into discrete phases with ectoderm adopting an internal position relative to the mesendoderm. The position adopted directly correlates with differences in tissue surface tension. We also show that germ layer tissues from untreated embryos, when extirpated and placed in culture, adopt a configuration similar to those of their mRNA-overexpressing counterparts. Down-regulating E-cadherin expression in the ectoderm leads to reduced surface tension and results in phase reversal with E-cadherin-depleted ectoderm cells now adopting an external position relative to the mesendoderm. These results show that in vitro cell sorting of zebrafish mesendoderm and ectoderm tissues is specified by tissue interfacial tensions. We perform a mathematical analysis indicating that tissue interfacial tension between actively motile cells contributes to the spatial organization and dynamics of these zebrafish germ layers in vivo.},

Here we study this question for a particular system, the slug stage of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd). We investigate how cells in the interior of a migrating slug can effectively transmit stress to the substrate and thereby contribute to the overall motive force. Theoretical analysis suggests necessary conditions on the behavior of individual cells, and computational results shed light on experimental results concerning the total force exerted by a migrating slug. The model predicts that only cells in contact with the substrate contribute to the translational motion of the slug. Since the model is not based specifically on the mechanical properties of Dd cells, the results suggest that this behavior will be found in many developing systems.},

abstract = {Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are key mediators of dorsoventral patterning in vertebrates and are required for the induction of ventral fates in fish and frogs. A widely accepted model of dorsoventral patterning postulates that a morphogenetic BMP activity gradient patterns cell fates along the dorsoventral axis. Recent work in zebrafish suggests that the role of BMP signaling changes over time, with BMPs required for global dorsoventral patterning during early gastrulation and for tail patterning during late gastrulation and early somitogenesis. Key questions remain about the late phase, including which BMP ligands are required and how the functions of BMPs differ during the early and late gastrula stages. In a screen for dominant enhancers of mutations in the homeobox genes vox and vent, which function in parallel to bmp signaling, we identified an insertion mutation in bmp4. We then performed a reverse genetic screen to isolate a null allele of bmp4. We report the characterization of these two alleles and demonstrate that BMP4 is required during the later phase of BMP signaling for the specification of ventroposterior cell fates. Our results indicate that different bmp genes are essential at different stages. In addition, we present genetic evidence supporting a role for a morphogenetic BMP gradient in establishing mesodermal fates during the later phase of BMP signaling.},

Using live confocal time-lapse images collected from Cy3-tagged fibronectin and plasma membrane tethered green fluorescent protein, we describe the movement and the elaboration of a complex fibrillar network undergoing topological rearrangements of fibrils on the surface of an embryonic tissue. Discrete processes of annealing, polymerization, stretching, breaking, and recoiling are recorded. Elaboration and maintenance of the complex topology of the extracellular matrix appears to require filamentous actin. These findings support a mechanical-model in which cell tractive forces elaborate the complex topological fibrillar network and are part of a homeostatic mechanism for the regulation of the extracellular matrix.},

These divisions highlight the changing spectrum of major developmental processes that occur during the first 3 days after fertilization, and we review some of what is known about morphogenesis and other significant events that occur during each of the periods. Stages subdivide the periods. Stages are named, not numbered as in most other series, providing for flexibility and continued evolution of the staging series as we learn more about development in this species. The stages, and their names, are based on morphological features, generally readily identified by examination of the live embryo with the dissecting stereomicroscope. The descriptions also fully utilize the optical transparancy of the live embryo, which provides for visibility of even very deep structures when the embryo is examined with the compound microscope and Nomarski interference contrast illumination. Photomicrographs and composite camera lucida line drawings characterize the stages pictorially. Other figures chart the development of distinctive characters used as staging aid signposts.},

abstract = {E-cadherin is maternally expressed in most vertebrate species, but its function during early development of the vertebrate embryo proper is unknown. To directly examine E-cadherin gene (cdh1) function in zebrafish, morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) that inhibit E-cadherin protein (Cdh1) expression were injected into embryos. Cdh1 knockdown reduced embryo survival. In early cdh1 MO-injected embryos, the cleavage plane orientation between blastomeres was irregular and adhesion defects prevented normal compaction. Cdh1 knockdown inhibited epiboly cell movements. Epiboly delay caused yolk cell lysis and produced embryos with a bifurcated embryonic axis. Cdh1 knockdown inhibited gastrulation cell movements, causing defects in convergence and extension. Additionally, prechordal plate derivatives were absent in Cdh1 knockdown embryos even though presumptive prechordal plate markers were induced normally. E-cadherin mRNA coinjection demonstrated the specificity of cdh1 MO-induced defects. Our experiments illustrate the importance of cdh1 in regulating morphogenetic cell movements and tissue formation in the early embryo.},

abstract = {The paper describes a mechanical model of epithelial tissue development in Drosophila embryos to investigate a buckling phenomenon called invagination. The finite element method is used to model this ventral furrow formation in 3D by decomposing the total deformation into two parts: an imposed active deformation, and an elastic passive deformation superimposed onto the latter. The model imposes as boundary conditions (i) a constant yolk volume and (ii) a sliding contact condition of the cells against the vitelline membrane, which is interpolated as a B-Spline surface. The active deformation simulates the effects of apical constriction and apico-basal elongation of cells. This set of local cellular mechanisms leads to global shape changes of the embryo which are associated with known gene expressions. Using the model we have tested different plausible hypotheses postulated to account for the mechanical behaviour of epithelial tissues. In particular, we conclude that only certain combinations of local cell shape change can successfully reproduce the invagination process. We have quantitatively compared the model with a 2D model and shown that it exhibits a more robust invagination phenomenon. The 3D model has also revealed that invagination causes a yolk flow from the central region to the anterior and posterior ends of the embryo, causing an accordion-like global compression and expansion wave to move through the embryo. Such a phenomenon cannot be described by 2D models.},

However, experiments described here show that these marginal blastoderm cells remain pluripotent and uncommitted throughout the late blastula and early gastrula stages. Embryonic cells become committed to a hypoblast-derived fate at mid-gastrulation. Time-lapse photographic analysis reveals that committed cells, when transplanted heterotopically and heterochronically, can migrate along atypical pathways to reposition themselves within a more correct environment.},

The first gene to be identified that encodes a Wnt signalling component, Int1 (integration 1), was molecularly characterized from mouse tumour cells 25 years ago. In parallel, the homologous gene Wingless in Drosophila melanogaster, which produces developmental defects in embryos, was characterized. Since then, further components of the Wnt pathway have been identified and their epistatic relationships have been defined. This article is a Timeline of crucial discoveries about the components and functions of this essential pathway.},

abstract = {We have asked whether oncogenesis by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), a slowly oncogenic retrovirus, involves integration of viral DNA within a certain region of the host genome. We first identified a C3H mouse mammary tumor bearing a single new MMTV provirus and cloned a 19 kilobase (kb) DNA restriction fragment containing a junction of viral and host sequences. Host sequences from this clone were used to retrieve 25 kb of the uninterrupted locus (termed MMTV int1) from a bacteriophage library of normal mouse DNA. Hybridization with subcloned DNA fragments of MMTV int1 detected abnormal restriction fragments in digests of DNA from 18 of 26 C3H mammary tumors. The rearrangements all appeared to be due to the insertion of an MMTV provirus, and the integration sites were located in at least five clusters over a total distance of 19 kb. A polyadenylated 2.6 kb RNA species transcribed from int1 was found in the few tumors tested, but not in lactating mammary glands from C3H mice. Of 12 tested viral oncogenes, none exhibited homology with cloned DNA from this locus. We propose that tumorigenesis by MMTV is strongly favored by proviral insertion within the int1 locus, perhaps as a consequence of enhanced expression of a novel cellular oncogene.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Regulation of gene expression is fundamental to the operation of a cell. Revealing the structure and dynamics of a gene regulatory network (GRN) is of great interest and represents a considerably challenging computational problem. The GRN estimation problem is complicated by the fact that the number of gene expression measurements is typically extremely small when compared to the dimension of the biological system. Further, because the gene regulation process is intrinsically complex, commonly used parametric models can provide too simple a description of the underlying phenomena and, thus, can be unreliable. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for the inference of GRNs from time-series and steady-state gene expression measurements. The presented framework is based on the use of Bayesian analysis with ordinary differential equations and nonparametric Gaussian process modeling for the transcriptional level regulation. RESULTS: The performance of the proposed structure inference method is evaluated using a recently published in vivo data set. By comparing the obtained results with those of existing ODEand Bayesian-based inference methods we demonstrate that the proposed method provides more accurate network structure learning. The predictive capabilities of the method are examined by splitting the data set into a training set and a test set and by predicting the test set based on the training set. AVAILABILITY: A MATLAB implementation of the method will beavailable from http://www.cs.tut.fi/~aijo2/gp/ upon publication. CONTACT: harri.lahdesmaki@tut.fi.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The luminal surface of the gut is lined with a monolayer of epithelial cells that acts as a nutrient absorptive engine and protective barrier. To maintain its integrity and functionality, the epithelium is renewed every few days. Theoretical models are powerful tools that can be used to test hypotheses concerning the regulation of this renewal process, to investigate how its dysfunction can lead to loss of homeostasis and neoplasia, and to identify potential therapeutic interventions. Here we propose a new multiscale model for crypt dynamics that links phenomena occurring at the subcellular, cellular and tissue levels of organisation. METHODS: At the subcellular level, deterministic models characterise molecular networks, such as cell-cycle control and Wnt signalling. The output of these models determines the behaviour of each epithelial cell in response to intra-, inter- and extracellular cues. The modular nature of the model enables us to easily modify individual assumptions and analyse their effects on the system as a whole. RESULTS: We perform virtual microdissection and labelling-index experiments, evaluate the impact of various model extensions, obtain new insight into clonal expansion in the crypt, and compare our predictions with recent mitochondrial DNA mutation data. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that relaxing the assumption that stem-cell positions are fixed enables clonal expansion and niche succession to occur. We also predict that the presence of extracellular factors near the base of the crypt alone suffices to explain the observed spatial variation in nuclear beta-catenin levels along the crypt axis.},

abstract = {Morphogenesis, the process by which all complex biological structures are formed, is driven by an intricate interplay between genes, growth, as well as intra- and intercellular forces. While the expression of different genes changes the mechanical properties and shapes of cells, growth exerts forces in response to which tissues, organs and more complex structures are shaped. This is exemplified by a number of recent findings for instance in meristem formation in Arabidopsis and tracheal tube formation in Drosophila. However, growth not only generates forces, mechanical forces can also have an effect on growth rates, as is seen in mammalian tissues or bone growth. In fact, mechanical forces can influence the expression levels of patterning genes, allowing control of morphogenesis via mechanical feedback. In order to study the connections between mechanical stress, growth control and morphogenesis, information about the distribution of stress in a tissue is invaluable. Here, we applied stress-birefringence to the wing imaginal disc of Drosophila melanogaster, a commonly used model system for organ growth and patterning, in order to assess the stress distribution present in this tissue. For this purpose, stress-related differences in retardance are measured using a custom-built optical set-up. Applying this method, we found that the stresses are inhomogeneously distributed in the wing disc, with maximum compression in the centre of the wing pouch. This compression increases with wing disc size, showing that mechanical forces vary with the age of the tissue. These results are discussed in light of recent models proposing mechanical regulation of wing disc growth.},

Several signaling pathways, such as BMP, FGF, Hedgehog, Nodal, and Wnt have well-recognized instructive roles in cell fate specification during vertebrate embryogenesis. Growing evidence indicates that BMP, Nodal, and FGF signaling also regulate cell movements, and that they do so through mechanisms distinct from those that specify cell fates. Moreover, pathways controlling cell movements can also indirectly influence cell fate specification by regulating dimensions and relative positions of interacting tissues. The current challenge is to delineate the molecular mechanisms via which the major signaling pathways regulate cell fate specification and movements, and how these two processes are coordinated to ensure normal development.},

abstract = {Vertebrate gastrulation entails massive cell movements that establish and shape the germ layers. During gastrulation, the individual cell behaviors are strictly coordinated in time and space by various signaling pathways. These pathways instruct the cells about proliferation, shape, fate and migration into proper location. Convergence and extension (C{\&}E) movements during vertebrate gastrulation play a major role in the shaping of the embryonic body. In vertebrates, the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (Wnt/PCP) pathway is a key regulator of C{\&}E movements, essential for several polarized cell behaviors, including directed cell migration, and mediolateral and radial cell intercalation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of Planar Cell Polarity by highly dynamic mesenchymal cells engaged in C{\&}E are still not well understood. Here we review new evidence implicating the Wnt/PCP pathway in specific cell behaviors required for C{\&}E during zebrafish gastrulation, in comparison to other vertebrates. We also discuss findings on the molecular regulation and the interaction of the Wnt/PCP pathway with other signaling pathways during gastrulation movements.},

The cell traction force (CTF) is not only essential for cell migration, but it is also used by cells to control their shape and maintain cellular homeostasis. As such, quantification of CTFs aids in better understanding of many fundamental biological processes such as morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and wound healing of tissues and organs. A new technology called cell traction force microscopy (CTFM) has been developed to determine CTFs in a quantitative fashion. The advantage of this technology is that it directly measures the "cause" (i.e., CTFs) of cell movement instead of the "effect" (i.e., cell movement itself), which is measured by various conventional methods. This chapter provides detailed information of materials and methods that are needed in order to perform typical CTFM experiments. Several examples are also given to illustrate various applications of CTFM in cell biology research.},

We aim at approaching these measurements through epithelial/deep cells classification, epithelial area and thickness measurement, and density estimation from scattered points. Our procedure is based on Minimal Surfaces, Otsu clustering, Delaunay Triangulation, and Within-R cloud of points density estimation approaches.

abstract = {The genomic developmental program operates mainly through the regulated expression of genes encoding transcription factors and signaling pathways. Complex networks of regulatory genetic interactions control developmental cell specification and fates. Development in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, has been studied extensively and large amounts of experimental data, including information on spatial and temporal gene expression patterns, are available. A wide variety of maternal and zygotic regulatory factors and signaling pathways have been discovered in zebrafish, and these provide a useful starting point for reconstructing the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlying development. In this review, we describe in detail the genetic regulatory subcircuits responsible for dorsoanterior-ventroposterior patterning and endoderm formation. We describe a number of regulatory motifs, which appear to act as the functional building blocks of the GRNs. Different positive feedback loops drive the ventral and dorsal specification processes. Mutual exclusivity in dorsal-ventral polarity in zebrafish is governed by intra-cellular cross-inhibiting GRN motifs, including vent/dharma and tll1/chordin. The dorsal-ventral axis seems to be determined by competition between two maternally driven positive-feedback loops (one operating on Dharma, the other on Bmp). This is the first systematic approach aimed at developing an integrated model of the GRNs underlying zebrafish development. Comparison of GRNs' organizational motifs between different species will provide insights into developmental specification and its evolution. The online version of the zebrafish GRNs can be found at http://www.zebrafishGRNs.org.},

abstract = {A central question in the development of multicellular organisms pertains to the timing and mechanisms of specification of the embryonic axes. In many organisms, specification of the dorsoventral axis requires signalling by proteins of the Transforming growth factor-beta and Wnt families. Here we show that maternal transcripts of the zebrafish Nodal-related morphogen, Squint (Sqt), can localize to two blastomeres at the four-cell stage and predict the dorsal axis. Removal of cells containing sqt transcripts from four-to-eight-cell embryos or injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides targeting sqt into oocytes can cause a loss of dorsal structures. Localization of sqt transcripts is independent of maternal Wnt pathway function and requires a highly conserved sequence in the 3' untranslated region. Thus, the dorsoventral axis is apparent by early cleavage stages and may require the maternally encoded morphogen Sqt and its associated factors. Because the 3' untranslated region of the human nodal gene can also localize exogenous sequences to dorsal cells, this mechanism may be evolutionarily conserved.},

abstract = {Cell aggregates are a tool for in vitro studies of morphogenesis, cancer invasion, and tissue engineering. They respond to mechanical forces as a complex rather than simple liquid. To change an aggregate's shape, cells have to overcome energy barriers. If cell shape fluctuations are active enough, the aggregate spontaneously relaxes stresses ("fluctuation-induced flow"). If not, changing the aggregate's shape requires a sufficiently large applied stress ("stress-induced flow"). To capture this distinction, we develop a mechanical model of aggregates based on their cellular structure. At stress lower than a characteristic stress tau*, the aggregate as a whole flows with an apparent viscosity eta*, and at higher stress it is a shear-thinning fluid. An increasing cell-cell tension results in a higher eta* (and thus a slower stress relaxation time t(c)). Our constitutive equation fits experiments of aggregate shape relaxation after compression or decompression in which irreversibility can be measured; we find t(c) of the order of 5 h for F9 cell lines. Predictions also match numerical simulations of cell geometry and fluctuations. We discuss the deviations from liquid behavior, the possible overestimation of surface tension in parallel-plate compression measurements, and the role of measurement duration.},

abstract = {Multicellular organisms are generated by coordinated cell movements during morphogenesis. Convergent extension is a key tissue movement that organizes mesoderm, ectoderm, and endoderm in vertebrate embryos. The goals of researchers studying convergent extension, and morphogenesis in general, include understanding the molecular pathways that control cell identity, establish fields of cell types, and regulate cell behaviors. Cell identity, the size and boundaries of tissues, and the behaviors exhibited by those cells shape the developing embryo; however, there is a fundamental gap between understanding the molecular pathways that control processes within single cells and understanding how cells work together to assemble multicellular structures. Theoretical and experimental biomechanics of embryonic tissues are increasingly being used to bridge that gap. The efforts to map molecular pathways and the mechanical processes underlying morphogenesis are crucial to understanding: (1) the source of birth defects, (2) the formation of tumors and progression of cancer, and (3) basic principles of tissue engineering. In this paper, we first review the process of tissue convergent extension of the vertebrate axis and then review models used to study the self-organizing movements from a mechanical perspective. We conclude by presenting a relatively simple "wedge-model" that exhibits key emergent properties of convergent extension such as the coupling between tissue stiffness, cell intercalation forces, and tissue elongation forces.},

Here we show that Fgf8 morphogen gradients in living zebrafish embryos are established and maintained by two essential factors: fast, free diffusion of single molecules away from the source through extracellular space, and a sink function of the receiving cells, regulated by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Evidence is provided by directly examining single molecules of Fgf8 in living tissue by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, quantifying their local mobility and concentration with high precision. By changing the degree of uptake of Fgf8 into its target cells, we are able to alter the shape of the Fgf8 gradient. Our results demonstrate that a freely diffusing morphogen can set up concentration gradients in a complex multicellular tissue by a simple source-sink mechanism.},

abstract = {During embryonic development, signalling molecules known as morphogens act in a concentration-dependent manner to provide positional information to responding tissues. In the early zebrafish embryo, graded signalling by members of the nodal family induces the formation of mesoderm and endoderm, thereby patterning the embryo into three germ layers. Nodal signalling has also been implicated in the establishment of the dorso-ventral axis of the embryo. Although one can infer the existence of nodal gradients by comparing gene expression patterns in wild-type embryos and embryos in which nodal signalling is diminished or augmented, real understanding can only come from directly observing the gradients. One approach is to determine local ligand concentrations in the embryo, but this is technically challenging, and the presence of inhibitors might cause the effective concentration of a ligand to differ from its actual concentration. We have therefore taken two approaches to visualise a direct response to nodal signalling. In the first, we have used transgenic embryos to study the nuclear accumulation of a Smad2-Venus fusion protein, and in the second we have used bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualise the formation of a complex between Smad2 and Smad4. This has allowed us to visualise, in living embryos, the formation of a graded distribution of nodal signalling activity. We have quantified the formation of the gradient in time and space, and our results not only confirm that nodal signalling patterns the embryo into three germ layers, but also shed light on its role in patterning the dorso-ventral axis and highlight unexpected complexities of mesodermal patterning.},

Here we test the morphogen properties of Cyclops and Squint-two Nodal-related transforming growth factor-beta signals required for mesoderm formation and patterning in zebrafish.

abstract = {Discrete rearranging patterns include cellular patterns, for instance liquid foams, biological tissues, grains in polycrystals; assemblies of particles such as beads, granular materials, colloids, molecules, atoms; and interconnected networks. Such a pattern can be described as a list of links between neighbouring sites. Performing statistics on the links between neighbouring sites yields average quantities (hereafter "tools") as the result of direct measurements on images. These descriptive tools are flexible and suitable for various problems where quantitative measurements are required, whether in two or in three dimensions. Here, we present a coherent set of robust tools, in three steps. First, we revisit the definitions of three existing tools based on the texture matrix. Second, thanks to their more general definition, we embed these three tools in a self-consistent formalism, which includes three additional ones. Third, we show that the six tools together provide a direct correspondence between a small scale, where they quantify the discrete pattern's local distortion and rearrangements, and a large scale, where they help describe a material as a continuous medium. This enables to formulate elastic, plastic, fluid behaviours in a common, self-consistent modelling using continuous mechanics. Experiments, simulations and models can be expressed in the same language and directly compared. As an example, a companion paper (P. Marmottant, C. Raufaste, and F. Graner, this issue, 25 (2008) DOI 10.1140/epje/i2007-10300-7) provides an application to foam plasticity.},

abstract = {In vertebrate embryos, maternal determinants are thought to preestablish the dorsoventral axis by locally activating zygotic ventral- and dorsal-specifying genes, e.g., genes encoding bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and BMP inhibitors, respectively. Whereas the canonical Wntbeta-catenin pathway fulfills this role dorsally, the existence of a reciprocal maternal ventralizing signal remains hypothetical. Maternal noncanonical WntCa(2+) signaling may promote ventral fates by suppressing Wntbeta-catenin dorsalizing signals; however, whether any maternal determinant is directly required for the activation of zygotic ventral-specifying genes is unknown. Here, we show that such a function is achieved, in part, in the zebrafish embryo by the maternally encoded transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling molecule, Radar. Loss-of-function experiments, together with epistasis analyses, identify maternal Radar as an upstream activator of bmps expression. Maternal induction of bmps by Radar is essential for zebrafish development as its removal results in larval-lethal dorsalized phenotypes. Double-morphant analyses further suggest that Radar functions through the TGF-beta receptor Alk8 to initiate the expression of bmp genes. Our results support the existence of a previously uncharacterized maternal ventralizing pathway. They might further indicate that maternal TGF-betaRdr and WntCa(2+) pathways complementarily specify ventral cell fates, with the former triggering bmps expression and the latter indirectly repressing genes encoding BMP antagonists.},

Here we demonstrate the genetic requirement for two different Bmp ligand subclass genes for dorsoventral pattern formation of the zebrafish embryo. From the relative efficiencies observed in Bmp ligand rescue experiments, conserved chromosomal synteny, and isolation of the zebrafish bmp7 gene, we determined that the strongly dorsalized snailhouse mutant phenotype is caused by a mutation in the bmp7 gene. We show that the original snailhouse allele is a hypomorphic mutation and we identify a snailhouse/bmp7 null mutant. We demonstrate that the snailhouse/bmp7 null mutant phenotype is identical to the presumptive null mutant phenotype of the strongest dorsalized zebrafish mutant swirl/bmp2b, revealing equivalent genetic roles for these two Bmp ligands. Double mutant snailhouse/bmp7; swirl/bmp2b embryos do not exhibit additional or stronger dorsalized phenotypes, indicating that these Bmp ligands do not function redundantly in early embryonic development. Furthermore, overexpression experiments reveal that Bmp2b and Bmp7 synergize in the ventralization of wild-type embryos through a cell-autonomous mechanism, suggesting that Bmp2b/Bmp7 heterodimers may act in vivo to specify ventral cell fates in the zebrafish embryo.},

In contrast to our understanding of the role of BMP in establishing ventral fates, our understanding of the role of Wnts in ventralizing embryos is less complete. Wnt8 is required for ventral patterning in both Xenopus and zebrafish; however, its mechanism of action remains unclear. We have used the zebrafish to address the requirement for Wnt8 in restricting the size of the dorsal organizer. Epistasis experiments suggest that Wnt8 achieves this restriction by regulating the early expression of the transcriptional repressors Vent and Vox. Our data show that vent and vox are direct transcriptional targets of Wnt8/beta-catenin. Additionally, we show that Wnt8 and Bmp2b co-regulate vent and vox in a dynamic fashion. Thus, whereas both Wnt8 and zygotic BMP are ventralizing agents that regulate common target genes, their temporally different modes of action are necessary to pattern the embryo harmoniously along its DV axis.},

abstract = {The maternal genome greatly influences vertebrate embryogenesis before activation of zygotic transcription. Dorsoventral patterning is initiated by maternal factors, but the molecular pathways involved are incompletely understood. In frogs and fish, localized zygotic domains are induced whereby cells either express dorsal or ventral genes. Wnt/beta-catenin signalling promotes expression of the earliest dorsal zygotic genes. Among key zygotic ventralizing factors are the bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps) and the Vent homeodomain family; the latter act as repressors of dorsal organizer gene transcription. Here we show that Runx2, a transcription factor essential for bone formation, is an important maternal determinant of ventral zygotic genes in zebrafish. Depletion of maternal Runx2b type2 strongly dorsalizes embryos, due to loss of the earliest zygotic expression of vox, vent and ved, resulting in expansion of dorsal gene expression. To date, Runx2b is the only known regulator of vox, vent and ved at the onset of zygotic transcription; we show that this regulation is direct. Runx2 transcripts are processed in mature mouse oocytes and we show that murine Runx2 type2 can substitute for the zebrafish orthologue in its ventralizing function, suggesting that Runx2 may have an evolutionarily conserved role in axis formation.},

This cascade is regulated at the cell surface by the opposing actions of the patched and smoothened molecules which together form a receptor complex for hedgehog. The discovery that inactivation of the human patched gene is responsible for familial and sporadic forms of basal cell carcinoma firmly established a role for dysregulation of hedgehog signalling in tumorigenesis. Other key members of this pathway have also been shown to be involved in tumour formation, as have more distal downstream targets of hedgehog signalling. Since it appears that tumorigenesis results from constitutive activation of hedgehog responsive genes, the identification of novel downstream targets of hedgehog signalling in given cell types is likely to increase our understanding of the molecular processes underlying tumour formation.},

abstract = {Zebrafish gastrulation entails morphogenetic cell movements that shape the body plan and give rise to an embryo with defined anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes. Regulating these cell movements are diverse signaling pathways and proteins including Wnts, Src-family tyrosine kinases, cadherins, and matrix metalloproteinases. While our knowledge of how these proteins impact cell polarity and migration has advanced considerably in the last decade, almost no data exist regarding the organization of extracellular matrix (ECM) during zebrafish gastrulation. Here, we describe for the first time the assembly of a fibronectin (FN) and laminin containing ECM in the early zebrafish embryo. This matrix was first detected at early gastrulation (65% epiboly) in the form of punctae that localize to tissue boundaries separating germ layers from each other and the underlying yolk cell. Fibrillogenesis increased after mid-gastrulation (80% epiboly) coinciding with the period of planar cell polarity pathway-dependent convergence and extension cell movements. We demonstrate that FN fibrils present beneath deep mesodermal cells are aligned in the direction of membrane protrusion formation. Utilizing antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, we further show that knockdown of FN expression causes a convergence and extension defect. Taken together, our data show that similar to amphibian embryos, the formation of ECM in the zebrafish gastrula is a dynamic process that occurs in parallel to at least a portion of the polarized cell behaviors shaping the embryonic body plan. These results provide a framework for uncovering the interrelationship between ECM structure and cellular processes regulating convergence and extension such as directed migration and mediolateral/radial intercalation.},

ECM and the cellular receptors that interact with it mediate both physical linkages with the cytoskeleton and the bidirectional flow of information between the extracellular and intracellular compartments. This review considers the range of cell and tissue functions attributed to ECM molecules and summarizes recent findings specific to key developmental processes. The importance of ECM as a dynamic repository for growth factors is highlighted along with more recent studies implicating the 3-dimensional organization and physical properties of the ECM as it relates to cell signaling and the regulation of morphogenetic cell behaviors. Embryonic cell and tissue generated forces and mechanical signals arising from ECM adhesion represent emerging areas of interest in this field.},

abstract = {Embryonic development involves global changes in tissue shape and architecture that are driven by cell shape changes and rearrangements within cohesive cell sheets. Morphogenetic changes at the cell and tissue level require that cells generate forces and that these forces are transmitted between the cells of a coherent tissue. Contractile forces generated by the actin-myosin cytoskeleton are critical for morphogenesis, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of contraction have been elusive for many cell shape changes and movements. Recent studies that have combined live imaging with computational and biophysical approaches have provided new insights into how contractile forces are generated and coordinated between cells and tissues. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the mechanical forces that shape cells, tissues, and embryos, emphasizing the different modes of actomyosin contraction that generate various temporal and spatial patterns of force generation.},

abstract = {Bifenthrin (BF) is widely used as a miticide in orchards, nurseries and homes due to its great photostability and insecticidal activity. Recently, extensive research has been conducted on the toxicity of BF in in vitro and in vivo assays. However, no data is so far available regarding the developmental toxicity of BF to fish in early life stages. In this study, the developmental effects of BF were evaluated in embryo-larval zebrafish. At specified stages (24, 48, 72, and 96hpf), spontaneous movement, survival and hatching as well as non-lethal malformation like curved body axis or edema were described in detail. No significant lethal effects of the treatment group compared to the control occurred except for the highest concentration group exposed for 96h. The hatching process was accelerated by BF in a concentration-dependent way, correlated with increasing spontaneous movement. Developmental abnormalities were observed for the test compound with 96-h EC(50) of 256microgL(-1) for pericardial edema, and 109microgL(-1) for curved body axis. Results from locomotor assays showed that zebrafish larvae of 96hpf exhibited impaired swimming behaviour after exposure to 50, 100, and 200microgL(-1) from 3 to 84hpf. After being cultured in the BF-free embryo medium for one more day till 120hpf, larvae from the 50microgL(-1)group seemed to have recovered and showed no difference in the swimming behaviour compared to the control while animals of the two higher concentration groups were exhausted and swam in significantly lower speed. Furthermore, reverse transcription real-time PCR results showed that vitellogenin I expressions were significantly induced in larval zebrafish exposed to 150microgL(-1) BF for 72h, indicating the disruption of the endocrine level. In summary, our studies showed that BF was developmentally toxic to zebrafish in early life stage after short-term exposure to sublethal concentrations and had the ability to impair the individual behaviours which are of great importance in the assessment of their ecological fitness.},

abstract = {Multiple molecular cues guide neuronal axons to their targets during development. Previous studies in vitro have shown that mechanical stimulation also can affect axon growth; however, whether mechanical force contributes to axon guidance in vivo is unknown. We investigated the role of muscle contractions in the guidance of zebrafish peripheral Rohon-Beard (RB) sensory axons in vivo. We analyzed several mutants that affect muscle contraction through different molecular pathways, including a new mutant allele of the titin a (pik) gene, mutants that affect the hedgehog signaling pathway, and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mutant. We found RB axon defects in these mutants, the severity of which appeared to correlate with the extent of muscle contraction loss. These axons extend between the muscle and skin and normally have ventral trajectories and repel each other on contact. RB peripheral axons in muscle mutants extend longitudinally instead of ventrally, and the axons fail to repel one another on contact. In addition, we showed that limiting muscle movements by embedding embryos in agarose caused similar defects in peripheral RB axon guidance. This work suggests that the mechanical forces generated by muscle contractions are necessary for proper sensory axon pathfinding in vivo.},

However, recent maternal-effect screens in the zebrafish have generated more than 40 unique mutants that are providing new molecular entry points to the maternal control of early vertebrate development.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The zebrafish, Danio rerio, possesses the paralogous genes aplnra and aplnrb that are duplicates of an ancestral orthologue of the human APLNR gene encoding a G-protein coupled receptor that binds the peptide ligand APELIN and is required for normal cardiovascular function. aplnrb is required for migration of cells contributing to heart development in zebrafish embryos. aplnra is transcribed in a complex pattern during early development but its function in embryogenesis is largely unknown. FINDINGS: Blockage of translation of aplnra mRNA in zebrafish embryos results in retarded or failed epiboly with the blastoderm apparently disconnected from the nuclei of the yolk syncytial layer. Gastrulation is also defective. Failure of correct tail extension is observed with ectopic structures resembling somites positioned dorsal to the spinal cord. CONCLUSION: aplnra, unlike its duplicate aplnrb, is essential for normal epiboly, although this function appears to be independent of signalling activated by zebrafish Apelin. The defects in epiboly caused by loss of aplnra activity appear, at least partially, to be due to a requirement for aplnra activity in the yolk syncytial layer.},

abstract = {The regulation of cleavage plane orientation is one of the key mechanisms driving epithelial morphogenesis. Still, many aspects of the relationship between local cleavage patterns and tissue-level properties remain poorly understood. Here we develop a topological model that simulates the dynamics of a 2D proliferating epithelium from generation to generation, enabling the exploration of a wide variety of biologically plausible cleavage patterns. We investigate a spectrum of models that incorporate the spatial impact of neighboring cells and the temporal influence of parent cells on the choice of cleavage plane. Our findings show that cleavage patterns generate "signature" equilibrium distributions of polygonal cell shapes. These signatures enable the inference of local cleavage parameters such as neighbor impact, maternal influence, and division symmetry from global observations of the distribution of cell shape. Applying these insights to the proliferating epithelia of five diverse organisms, we find that strong division symmetry and moderate neighbor/maternal influence are required to reproduce the predominance of hexagonal cells and low variability in cell shape seen empirically. Furthermore, we present two distinct cleavage pattern models, one stochastic and one deterministic, that can reproduce the empirical distribution of cell shapes. Although the proliferating epithelia of the five diverse organisms show a highly conserved cell shape distribution, there are multiple plausible cleavage patterns that can generate this distribution, and experimental evidence suggests that indeed plants and fruitflies use distinct division mechanisms.},

abstract = {During development, functional structures must form with the correct three-dimensional geometry composed of the correct cell types. In many cases cell types are specified at locations distant to where they will ultimately reside for normal biological function. Although cell migration is crucial for normal development and morphogenesis of animal body plans and organ systems, abnormal cell migration during adult life underlies pathological states such as invasion and metastasis of cancer. In both contexts cells migrate either individually, as loosely associated sheets or as clusters of cells. In this review, we summarize, compare and integrate knowledge gained from several in vivo model systems that have yielded insights into the regulation of morphogenic cell migration, such as the zebrafish lateral line primordium and primordial germ cells, Drosophila border cell clusters, vertebrate neural crest migration and angiogenic sprouts in the post-natal mouse retina. Because of its broad multicontextual and multiphylletic distribution, understanding cell migration in its various manifestations in vivo is likely to provide new insights into both the function and malfunction of key embryonic and postembryonic events. In this review, we will provide a succinct phenotypic description of the many model systems utilized to study cell migration in vivo. More importantly, we will highlight, compare and integrate recent advances in our understanding of how cell migration is regulated in these varied model systems with special emphasis on individual and collective cell movements.},

abstract = {Collective cell migration is a key process during the development of most organisms. It can involve either the migration of closely packed mesenchymal cells that make dynamic contacts with frequently changing neighbour cells, or the migration of epithelial sheets that typically display more stable cell-cell interactions and less frequent changes in neighbours. These collective movements can be controlled by short- or long-range dynamic gradients of extracellular signalling molecules, depending on the number of cells involved and their distance of migration. These gradients are sensed by some or all of the migrating cells and translated into directed migration, which in many settings is further modulated by cell-contact-mediated attractive or repulsive interactions that result in contact-following or contact-inhibition of locomotion, respectively. Studies of collective migration of groups of epithelial cells during development indicate that, in some cases, only leader cells sense and migrate up an external signal gradient, and that adjacent cells follow through strong cell-cell contacts. In this Commentary, I review studies of collective cell migration of differently sized cell populations during the development of several model organisms, and discuss our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that coordinate this migration.},

abstract = {Histone variants and their modification have significant roles in many cellular processes. In this study, we identified and characterized the histone H2A variant h2af1o in fish and revealed its oocyte-specific expression pattern during oogenesis and embryogenesis. Moreover, posttranslational modification of H2af1o was observed that results from phosphorylation during oocyte maturation. To understand the binding dynamics of the novel core histone variant H2af1o in nucleosomes, we cloned ubiquitous gibel carp h2afx as a conventional histone control and investigated the dynamic exchange difference in chromatin by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. H2af1o has significantly higher mobility in nucleosomes than ubiquitous H2afx. Compared with ubiquitous H2afx, H2af1o has a tightly binding C-terminal and a weakly binding N-terminal. These data indicate that fish oocytes have a novel H2A variant that destabilizes nucleosomes by protruding its N-terminal tail and stabilizes core particles by contracting its C-terminal tail. Our findings suggest that H2af1o may have intrinsic ability to modify chromatin properties during fish oogenesis, oocyte maturation, and early cleavage.},

The importance of where and when these interactions take place in the nucleus is currently a subject of intense investigation.

At the same time, however, structural constraints impose limits on chromatin mobility. Understanding how the dynamic nature of the positioning of genetic material in the nuclear space and the higher-order architecture of the nucleus are integrated is therefore essential to our overall understanding of gene regulation.},

Advances in our understanding of these behaviours have been recently gained through quantitative models that describe how molecules such as transcription factors and nucleosomes interact with genomic sequences. An emerging view is that every regulatory sequence is associated with a unique binding affinity landscape for each molecule and, consequently, with a unique set of molecule-binding configurations and transcriptional outputs. We present a quantitative framework based on existing methods that unifies these ideas. This framework explains many experimental observations regarding the binding patterns of factors and nucleosomes and the dynamics of transcriptional activation. It can also be used to model more complex phenomena such as transcriptional noise and the evolution of transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Tissue heating has been employed to study a variety of biological processes, including the study of genes that control embryonic development. Conditional regulation of gene expression is a particularly powerful approach for understanding gene function. One popular method for mis-expressing a gene of interest employs heat-inducible heat shock protein (hsp) promoters. Global heat shock of hsp-promoter-containing transgenic animals induces gene expression throughout all tissues, but does not allow for spatial control. Local heating allows for spatial control of hsp-promoter-driven transgenes, but methods for local heating are cumbersome and variably effective. RESULTS: We describe a simple, highly controllable, and versatile apparatus for heating biological tissue and other materials on the micron-scale. This microheater employs micron-scale fiber optics and uses an inexpensive laser-pointer as a power source. Optical fibers can be pulled on a standard electrode puller to produce tips of varying sizes that can then be used to reliably heat 20-100 um targets. We demonstrate precise spatiotemporal control of hsp70l:GFP transgene expression in a variety of tissue types in zebrafish embryos and larvae. We also show how this system can be employed as part of a new method for lineage tracing that would greatly facilitate the study of organogenesis and tissue regulation at any time in the life cycle. CONCLUSION: This versatile and simple local heater has broad utility for the study of gene function and for lineage tracing. This system could be used to control hsp-driven gene expression in any organism simply by bringing the fiber optic tip in contact with the tissue of interest. Beyond these uses for the study of gene function, this device has wide-ranging utility in materials science and could easily be adapted for therapeutic purposes in humans.},

abstract = {This paper is comprised of two parts. In the first we provide a brief overview of grid-free methods for modeling multicellular systems. We focus on an approach based on Langevin equations, in which inertia is ignored, and stochastic effects on cell motion are included. The discussion starts with simpler models, in which cells are modeled as adhesive spheres. We then turn to more sophisticated approaches in which nontrivial cell shape is accommodated, including the recently introduced Subcellular Element Model, in which each cell is described as a cluster of adhesively coupled over-damped subcellular elements, representing patches of cytoskeleton. In the second part of the paper we illustrate the use of a standard grid-free cell-based model to computationally probe interesting new features associated with primitive streak formation in the chick embryo. Streak formation is a key developmental step in amniotes (i.e., birds, reptiles, and mammals), and can be observed in detail in the chick embryo, where the streak extends across a tightly-packed two-dimensional sheet (the epiblast) comprised of about 50,000 cells. The Weijer group [Cui, Yang, Chuai, Glazier, and Weijer, Dev. Biol. 284 (2005) 37-47] recently observed that streak formation is accompanied by coordinated cell movement lateral to the streak, resulting in two large counter-rotating vortices. We study a mechanism based on cell polarity (in the plane of the epiblast) that provides an explanation for these vortices, and test it successfully using computer simulations. This mechanism is robust, since the emergent vortex formation depends only on the gross features of the initial spatial distribution of planar polarity in the epiblast.},

Within this model framework, each cell is represented by a collection of elastically coupled elements, interacting with one another via short-range potentials, and dynamically updated using over-damped Langevin dynamics. The SEM can also be used to represent a single cell in more detail, by using a larger number of subcellular elements exclusively identified with that cell. We have tested whether, in this context, the SEM yields viscoelastic properties consistent with those measured on single living cells. Employing virtual methods of bulk rheology and microrheology we find that the SEM successfully captures many cellular rheological properties at intermediate time scales and moderate strains, including weak power law rheology. In its simplest guise, the SEM cannot describe long-time/large-strain cell responses. Capturing these cellular properties requires extensions of the SEM which incorporate active cytoskeletal rearrangement. Such extensions will be the subject of a future publication.},

We present here a detailed description of the model, and use successive mean-field approximations to connect it to more coarse-grained approaches, such as discrete cell-based algorithms and coupled partial differential equations. We also discuss efficient algorithms for encoding the model, and give an example of a simulation of an epithelial sheet. Given the biological flexibility of the model, we propose that it can be used effectively for modeling a range of multicellular processes, such as tumor dynamics and embryogenesis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Simulation of sophisticated biological models requires considerable computational power. These models typically integrate together numerous biological phenomena such as spatially-explicit heterogeneous cells, cell-cell interactions, cell-environment interactions and intracellular gene networks. The recent advent of programming for graphical processing units (GPU) opens up the possibility of developing more integrative, detailed and predictive biological models while at the same time decreasing the computational cost to simulate those models.

RESULTS:We construct a 3D model of epidermal development and provide a set of GPU algorithms that executes significantly faster than sequential central processing unit (CPU) code. We provide a parallel implementation of the subcellular element method for individual cells residing in a lattice-free spatial environment. Each cell in our epidermal model includes an internal gene network, which integrates cellular interaction of Notch signaling together with environmental interaction of basement membrane adhesion, to specify cellular state and behaviors such as growth and division. We take a pedagogical approach to describing how modeling methods are efficiently implemented on the GPU including memory layout of data structures and functional decomposition. We discuss various programmatic issues and provide a set of design guidelines for GPU programming that are instructive to avoid common pitfalls as well as to extract performance from the GPU architecture.

CONCLUSIONS:We demonstrate that GPU algorithms represent a significant technological advance for the simulation of complex biological models. We further demonstrate with our epidermal model that the integration of multiple complex modeling methods for heterogeneous multicellular biological processes is both feasible and computationally tractable using this new technology. We hope that the provided algorithms and source code will be a starting point for modelers to develop their own GPU implementations, and encourage others to implement their modeling methods on the GPU and to make that code available to the wider community.},

abstract = {Development of spatial patterns in multicellular organisms depends on gradients in the concentration of signaling molecules that control gene expression. In the Drosophila embryo, Bicoid (Bcd) morphogen controls cell fate along 70% of the anteroposterior axis but is translated from mRNA localized at the anterior pole. Gradients of Bcd and other morphogens are thought to arise through diffusion, but this basic assumption has never been rigorously tested in living embryos. Furthermore, because diffusion sets a relationship between length and time scales, it is hard to see how patterns of gene expression established by diffusion would scale proportionately as egg size changes during evolution. Here, we show that the motion of inert molecules through the embryo is well described by the diffusion equation on the relevant length and time scales, and that effective diffusion constants are essentially the same in closely related dipteran species with embryos of very different size. Nonetheless, patterns of gene expression in these different species scale with egg length. We show that this scaling can be traced back to scaling of the Bcd gradient itself. Our results, together with constraints imposed by the time scales of development, suggest that the mechanism for scaling is a species-specific adaptation of the Bcd lifetime.},

Gradients form by morphogen transport from a localized site, but whether this occurs by simple diffusion or by more elaborate mechanisms is unclear. We attempt to resolve this controversy by analyzing recent data in ways that appropriately capture the complexity of systems in which transport, receptor interaction, endo- and exocytosis, and degradation occur together. We find that diffusive mechanisms of morphogen transport are much more plausible-and nondiffusive mechanisms much less plausible-than has generally been argued. Moreover, we show that a class of experiments, endocytic blockade, thought to effectively distinguish between diffusive and nondiffusive transport models actually fails to draw useful distinctions.},

abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes the differentiation switch between polarized epithelial cells and contractile and motile mesenchymal cells, and facilitates cell movements and generation of new tissue types during embryogenesis. Many secreted polypeptides are implicated in the EMT process and their corresponding intracellular transduction pathways form highly interconnected networks. Transforming growth factor-beta, Wnt, Notch and growth factors acting through tyrosine kinase receptors induce EMT and often act in a sequential manner. Such growth factors orchestrate the concerted regulation of an elaborate gene program and a complex protein network, needed for establishment of new mesenchymal phenotypes after disassembly of the main elements of epithelial architecture, such as desmosomes, as well as tight, adherens and gap junctions. EMT of tumor cells occurs during cancer progression and possibly generates cell types of the tumor stroma, such as cancer-associated myofibroblasts. EMT contributes to new tumor cell properties required for invasiveness and vascular intravasation during metastasis. Here we present some of the current mechanisms that mediate the process of EMT and discuss their relevance to cancer progression.},

It has been hypothesized that the directionality of cell movement during collective migration emerges as a collective property [3, 4]. Here we determine how movement directionality is established in collective mesendoderm migration during zebrafish gastrulation. By interfering with two key features of collective migration, (1) having neighboring cells and (2) adhering to them, we show that individual mesendoderm cells are capable of normal directed migration when moving as single cells but require cell-cell adhesion to participate in coordinated and directed migration when moving as part of a group. We conclude that movement directionality is not a de novo collective property of mesendoderm cells but rather a property of single mesendoderm cells that requires cell-cell adhesion during collective migration.},

Previous work has suggested that cells migrate as individuals, with collective movement resulting from the addition of similar individual cell behavior. Through extensive analyses of cell trajectories, morphologies, and polarization in zebrafish embryos, we reveal that all prechordal plate cells show the same behavior and rely on the same signaling pathway to migrate, as expected if they do so individually. However, by using cell transplants, we demonstrate that prechordal plate migration is a true collective process, as isolated cells do not migrate toward the animal pole. They are still polarized and motile but lose directionality. Directionality is restored upon contact with the endogenous prechordal plate. This contact dependent orientation relies on E-cadherin, Wnt-PCP signaling, and Rac1. Importantly, groups of cells also need contact with the endogenous plate to orient correctly, showing an instructive role of the plate in establishing directionality. Overall, our results lead to an original model of collective migration in which directional information is contained within the moving group rather than provided by extrinsic cues, and constantly maintained in cells by contacts with their neighbors. This self-organizing model could account for collective invasion of new territories, as observed in cancer strands, without requirement for any attractant in the colonized tissue.},

abstract = {The mechanism of embryonic polarity establishment in mammals has long been controversial. Whereas some claim prepatterning in the egg, we recently presented evidence that mouse embryonic polarity is not established until blastocyst and proposed the mechanical constraint model. Here we apply computer simulation to clarify the minimal cellular properties required for this morphology. The simulation is based on three assumptions: (1) behavior of cell aggregates is simulated by a 3D vertex dynamics model; (2) all cells have equivalent mechanical properties; (3) an inner cavity with equivalent surface properties is gradually enlarged. However, an initial attempt reveals a requirement for an additional assumption: (4) the surface of the cavity is firmer than intercellular surfaces, suggesting the presence of a basement membrane lining the blastocyst cavity, which is indeed confirmed by published data. The simulation thus successfully produces a structure recapitulating the mouse blastocyst. The axis of the blastocyst, however, remains variable, leading us to an additional assumption: (5) the aggregate is enclosed by a capsule, equivalent to the zona pellucida in vivo. Whereas a spherical capsule does not stabilize the blastocyst axis, an ellipsoidal capsule eventually orients the axis in accordance with its longest diameter. These predictions are experimentally verified by time-lapse recordings of mouse embryos. During simulation, equivalent cells form two distinct populations composed of smaller inner cells and larger outer cells. These results reveal a unique feature of early mammalian development: an asymmetry may emerge autonomously in an equivalent population with no need for a priori intrinsic differences.},

abstract = {A number of biological processes, such as embryo development, cancer metastasis or wound healing, rely on cells moving in concert. The mechanisms leading to the emergence of coordinated motion remain however largely unexplored. Although biomolecular signalling is known to be involved in most occurrences of collective migration, the role of physical and mechanical interactions has only been recently investigated. In this study, a versatile framework for cell motility is implemented in silico in order to study the minimal requirements for the coordination of a group of epithelial cells. We find that cell motility and cell-cell mechanical interactions are sufficient to generate a broad array of behaviours commonly observed in vitro and in vivo. Cell streaming, sheet migration and susceptibility to leader cells are examples of behaviours spontaneously emerging from these simple assumptions, which might explain why collective effects are so ubiquitous in nature. The size of the population and its confinement appear, in particular, to play an important role in the coordination process. In all cases, the complex response of the population can be predicted from the knowledge of the correlation length of the velocity field measured in the bulk of the epithelial layer. This analysis provides also new insights into cancer metastasis and cell sorting, suggesting, in particular, that collective invasion might result from an emerging coordination in a system where single cells are mechanically unable to invade.},

abstract = {The role of geometrical confinement on collective cell migration has been recognized but has not been elucidated yet. Here, we show that the geometrical properties of the environment regulate the formation of collective cell migration patterns through cell-cell interactions. Using microfabrication techniques to allow epithelial cell sheets to migrate into strips whose width was varied from one up to several cell diameters, we identified the modes of collective migration in response to geometrical constraints. We observed that a decrease in the width of the strips is accompanied by an overall increase in the speed of the migrating cell sheet. Moreover, large-scale vortices over tens of cell lengths appeared in the wide strips whereas a contraction-elongation type of motion is observed in the narrow strips. Velocity fields and traction force signatures within the cellular population revealed migration modes with alternative pulling and/or pushing mechanisms that depend on extrinsic constraints. Force transmission through intercellular contacts plays a key role in this process because the disruption of cell-cell junctions abolishes directed collective migration and passive cell-cell adhesions tend to move the cells uniformly together independent of the geometry. Altogether, these findings not only demonstrate the existence of patterns of collective cell migration depending on external constraints but also provide a mechanical explanation for how large-scale interactions through cell-cell junctions can feed back to regulate the organization of migrating tissues.},

abstract = {A longstanding question in molecular biology is the extent to which the behavior of macromolecules observed in vitro accurately reflects their behavior in vivo. A number of sophisticated experimental techniques now allow the behavior of individual types of macromolecule to be studied directly in vivo; none, however, allow a wide range of molecule types to be observed simultaneously. In order to tackle this issue we have adopted a computational perspective, and, having selected the model prokaryote Escherichia coli as a test system, have assembled an atomically detailed model of its cytoplasmic environment that includes 50 of the most abundant types of macromolecules at experimentally measured concentrations. Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of the cytoplasm model have been calibrated to reproduce the translational diffusion coefficients of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) observed in vivo, and "snapshots" of the simulation trajectories have been used to compute the cytoplasm's effects on the thermodynamics of protein folding, association and aggregation events. The simulation model successfully describes the relative thermodynamic stabilities of proteins measured in E. coli, and shows that effects additional to the commonly cited "crowding" effect must be included in attempts to understand macromolecular behavior in vivo.},

abstract = {The establishment of complex expression patterns at precise times and locations is key to metazoan development, yet a mechanistic understanding of the underlying transcription control networks is still missing. Here we describe a novel thermodynamic model that computes expression patterns as a function of cis-regulatory sequence and of the binding-site preferences and expression of participating transcription factors. We apply this model to the segmentation gene network of Drosophila melanogaster and find that it predicts expression patterns of cis-regulatory modules with remarkable accuracy, demonstrating that positional information is encoded in the regulatory sequence and input factor distribution. Our analysis reveals that both strong and weaker binding sites contribute, leading to high occupancy of the module DNA, and conferring robustness against mutation; short-range homotypic clustering of weaker sites facilitates cooperative binding, which is necessary to sharpen the patterns. Our computational framework is generally applicable to most protein-DNA interaction systems.},

abstract = {An inroad into an understanding of the complex molecular interactions on which development is based can be achieved by uncovering the minimum requirements that describe elementary steps and their linkage. Organizing regions and other signaling centers can be generated by reactions that involve local self-enhancement coupled to antagonistic reactions of longer range. More complex patterns result from a chaining of such reactions in which one pattern generates the prerequisites for the next. Patterning along the single axis of radial symmetric animals including the small freshwater polyp hydra can be explained in this way. The body pattern of such ancestral organisms evolved into the brain of higher organisms, while trunk and midline formation are later evolutionary additions. The equivalent of the hydra organizer is the blastopore, for instance, the marginal zone in amphibians. It organizes the anteroposterior axis. The Spemann organizer, located on this primary organizer, initiates and elongates the midline, which is responsible for the dorsoventral pattern. In contrast, midline formation in insects is achieved by an inhibitory signal from a dorsal organizer that restricts the midline to the ventral side. Thus, different modes of midline formation are proposed to be the points of no return in the separation of phyla. The conversion of the transient patterns of morphogenetic signaling into patterns of stable gene activation can be achieved by genes whose gene products have a positive feedback on the activity of their own gene. If several such autoregulatory genes mutually exclude each other, a cell has to make an unequivocal decision to take a particular pathway. Under the influence of a gradient, sharply confined regions with particular determinations can emerge. Borders between regions of different gene activities, and the areas of intersection of two such borders, become the new signaling centers that initiate secondary embryonic fields. As required for leg and wing formation, these new fields emerge in pairs at defined positions, with defined orientation and left-right handedness. Recent molecular-genetic results provide strong support for theoretically predicted interactions. By computer simulations it is shown that the regulatory properties of these models correspond closely to experimental observations (animated simulations are available at www.eb.tuebingen.mpg.de/meinhardt).},

abstract = {A multi-scale strategy is presented for simulating organogenesis that uses a single cell response function to define the behavior of individual cells in an organ-scale simulation of a large cell population. The response function summarizes detailed information about the behavior of individual cells in a sufficiently economical way that the organ-scale model can be commensurate with the entire organ. The first application demonstrates the effects of strain stimulus on the migration of ameloblasts during enamel formation. Ameloblasts are an attractive study case because mineralization preserves a complete record of their migratory paths. The response function in this case specifies the motions of cells responding to strain stimuli that propagate through the population. The strain stimuli are related to the curvature of the surface from which the ameloblasts migrate (the dentin-enamel junction or DEJ). A single unknown rate parameter is calibrated by an independent datum from the human tooth. With no remaining adjustable parameters, the theory correctly predicts aspects of the fracture-resistant, wavy microstructure of enamel in the human molar, including wavelength variations and the rate of wave amplitude damping. At a critical value of curvature of the DEJ, a transition in the ordering of cells occurs, from invariant order over the whole population to self-assembly of the population into groups or gangs. The prediction of an ordering transition and the predicted critical curvature are consistent with gnarled enamel in the cusps of the human molar. The calibration of the model using human data also predicts waves in the mouse incisor and an ordering transition at the chimpanzee cingulum. Widespread compressive strain is predicted late in the migration for both the human molar and mouse incisor, providing a possible signal for the termination of amelogenesis.},

abstract = {Formation of the primitive streak is one of the key events in the early development of amniote embryos. The streak is the site where during gastrulation the mesendoderm cells ingress to take up their correct topographical positions in the embryo. The process of streak formation can be conveniently observed in the chick embryo, where the streak forms as an accumulation of cells in the epiblast in the posterior pole of the embryo and extends subsequently in anterior direction until it covers 80% of the epiblast. A prerequisite for streak formation is the differentiation of mesoderm, which is induced in the epiblast at the interface between the posterior Area Opaca and Area Pellucida in a sickle shaped domain overlying Koller's sickle. Current views on the molecular mechanisms of mesoderm induction by inducing signals from the Area Opaca and inhibitory signals from the hypoblast are briefly discussed. During streak formation the sickle of mesoderm cells transforms into an elongated structure in the central midline of the embryo. We discuss possible cellular mechanisms underlying this process, such as oriented cell division, cell-cell intercalation, chemotactic cell movement in response to attractive and repulsive signals and a combination of chemotaxis and contact following. We review current experimental evidence in favor and against these different hypotheses and outline some the outstanding questions. Since many of the interactions between cells signaling and moving are dynamic and nonlinear in nature they will require detailed modeling and computer simulations to be understood in detail.},

abstract = {During gastrulation in vertebrates, mesenchymal cells at the anterior end of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) periodically compact, transiently epithelialize and detach from the posterior PSM to form somites. In the prevailing clock-and-wavefront model of somitogenesis, periodic gene expression, particularly of Notch and Wnt, interacts with an FGF8-based thresholding mechanism to determine cell fates. However, this model does not explain how cell determination and subsequent differentiation translates into somite morphology. In this paper, we use computer simulations of chick somitogenesis to show that experimentally-observed temporal and spatial patterns of adhesive N-CAM and N-cadherin and repulsive EphA4-ephrinB2 pairs suffice to reproduce the complex dynamic morphological changes of somitogenesis in wild-type and N-cadherin (-/-) chick, including intersomitic separation, boundary-shape evolution and sorting of misdifferentiated cells across compartment boundaries.

abstract = {Living organisms, from bacteria to vertebrates, are well known to generate sophisticated multicellular patterns. Numerous recent interdisciplinary studies have focused on the formation and regulation of these structures. Advances in automatized microscopy allow the time-resolved tracking of embryonic development at cellular resolution over an extended area covering most of the embryo. The resulting images yield simultaneous information on the motion of multiple tissue components-both cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers. Recent studies on ECM displacements in bird embryos resulted in a method to distinguish tissue deformation and cell-autonomous motion. Patterning of the primary vascular plexus results from a collective action of primordial endothelial cells. The emerging "polygonal" vascular structure is shown to be formed by cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions: adhesion and protrusive activity (sprouting). Utilizing avb3 integrins, multicellular sprouts invade rapidly into avascular areas. Sprout elongation, in turn, depends on a continuous supply of endothelial cells. Endothelial cells migrate along the sprout, towards its tip, in a vascular endothelial (VE) cadherin-dependent process. The observed abundance of multicellular sprout formation in various in vitro and in vivo systems can be explained by a general mechanism based on preferential attraction to elongated structures. Our interacting particle model exhibits robust sprouting dynamics and results in patterns with morphometry similar to native primordial vascular plexuses--without ancillary assumptions involving chemotaxis or mechanochemical signaling.},

After discovery of the involvement of several key toolkit genes--FGF10, BMP4, and Shh, huge amount of molecular information on lung development is now available. However, how their interactions result in a branched structure has not been elucidated. Recently, some studies have utilized mathematical models to understand the mechanism of branching morphogenesis, and we now have some models which are reliable enough to make experimental predictions in the in vitro system. In addition, a different type of modeling, which generates tree-like branching pattern by repeatedly applying a set of simple rules iteratively, is also utilized to model lung function. In this review, I focus on how these models can contribute to understand pattern formation phenomena from experimental biologist's point of view.},

abstract = {Dynamical systems in which geometrically extended model cells produce and interact with diffusible (morphogen) and nondiffusible (extracellular matrix) chemical fields have proved very useful as models for developmental processes. The embryonic vertebrate limb is an apt system for such mathematical and computational modeling since it has been the subject of hundreds of experimental studies, and its normal and variant morphologies and spatiotemporal organization of expressed genes are well known. Because of its stereotypical proximodistally generated increase in the number of parallel skeletal elements, the limb lends itself to being modeled by Turing-type systems which are capable of producing periodic, or quasiperiodic, arrangements of spot- and stripe-like elements. This chapter describes several such models, including, (i) a system of partial differential equations in which changing cell density enters into the dynamics explicitly, (ii) a model for morphogen dynamics alone, derived from the latter system in the "morphostatic limit" where cell movement relaxes on a much slower time-scale than cell differentiation, (iii) a discrete stochastic model for the simplified pattern formation that occurs when limb cells are placed in planar culture, and (iv) several hybrid models in which continuum morphogen systems interact with cells represented as energy-minimizing mesoscopic entities. Progress in devising computational methods for handling 3D, multiscale, multimodel simulations of organogenesis is discussed, as well as for simulating reaction-diffusion dynamics in domains of irregular shape.},

abstract = {One of the aims of developmental biology is to understand how a single egg cell gives rise to the complex spatial distributions of cell types and extracellular components of the adult phenotype. This review discusses the main genetic and epigenetic interactions known to play a role in tooth development and how they can be integrated into coherent models. Along the same lines, several hypotheses about aspects of tooth development that are currently not well understood are evaluated. This is done from their morphological consequences from the model and how these fit known morphological variation and change during tooth development. Thus the aim of this review is two-fold. On one hand the model and its comparison with experimental evidence will be used to outline our current understanding about tooth morphogenesis. On the other hand these same comparisons will be used to introduce a computational model that makes accurate predictions on three-dimensional morphology and patterns of gene expression by implementing cell signaling, proliferation and mechanical interactions between cells. In comparison with many other models of development this model includes reaction-diffusion-like dynamics confined to a diffusion chamber (the developing tooth) that changes in shape in three-dimensions over time. These changes are due to mechanical interactions between cells triggered by the proliferation enhancing effect of the reactants (growth factors). In general, tooth morphogenesis can be understood from the indirect cross-regulation between extracellular signals, the local regulation of proliferation and differentiation rates by these signals and the effect of intermediate developing morphology on the diffusion, dilution, and spatial distribution of these signals. Overall, this review should be interesting to either readers interested in the mechanistic bases of tooth morphogenesis, without necessarily being interested in modeling per se, and readers interested in development modeling in general.},

Mathematical models allow for the analysis of cell migration strategies involving complex feedback mechanisms between the cells and their microenvironment. Here, we introduce a cellular automaton (especially lattice-gas cellular automaton-LGCA) as a microscopic model of cell migration together with a (mathematical) tensor characterization of different biological environments. Furthermore, we show how mathematical analysis of the LGCA model can yield an estimate for the cell dispersion speed within a given environment. Novel imaging techniques like diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may provide tensor data of biological microenvironments. As an application, we present LGCA simulations of a proliferating cell population moving in an external field defined by clinical DTI data. This system can serve as a model of in vivo glioma cell invasion.},

abstract = {In the past few decades, it has become increasingly popular and important to utilize mathematical models to understand how microscopic intercellular interactions lead to the macroscopic pattern formation ubiquitous in the biological world. Modeling methodologies come in a large variety and presently it is unclear what is their interrelationship and the assumptions implicit in their use. They can be broadly divided into three categories according to the spatial scale they purport to describe: the molecular, the cellular and the tissue scales. Most models address dynamics at the tissue-scale, few address the cellular scale and very few address the molecular scale. Of course there would be no dissent between models or at least the underlying assumptions would be known if they were all rigorously derived from a molecular level model, in which case the laws of physics and chemistry are very well known. However in practice this is not possible due to the immense complexity of the problem. A simpler approach is to derive models at a coarse scale from an intermediate scale model which has the special property of being based on biology and physics which are experimentally well studied. In this article we use such an approach to understand the assumptions inherent in the use of the most popular models, the tissue-level ones. Such models are found to invariably rely on the hidden assumption that statistical correlations between cells can be neglected. This often means that the predictions of these models are qualitatively correct but may fail in spatial regions where cell concentration is small, particularly if there are strong long-range correlations in cell movement. Such behavior can only be properly taken into account by cellular models. However such models unlike the tissue-level models are frequently not easily amenable to analysis, except when the number of interacting cells is small or when the interactions are weak, and thus are rather more suited for simulation. Hence it is our conclusion that the simultaneous theoretical and numerical analysis of models of the same biological system at different spatial scales provides a more robust method of understanding biological systems than the utilization of a single scale model. In particular this enables one to clearly separate nonphysical predictions stemming from model artifacts from those due to genuine physiological behavior.},

abstract = {A distinguishing feature of a multicellular living system is that it operates at various scales, from the intracellular to organismal. Genes and molecules set up the conditions for the physical processes to act, in particular to shape the embryo. As development continues the changes brought about by the physical processes lead to changes in gene expression. It is this coordinated interplay between genetic and generic (i.e., physical and chemical) processes that constitutes the modern understanding of early morphogenesis. It is natural to assume that in this multiscale process the smaller defines the larger. In case of biophysical properties, in particular, those at the subcellular level are expected to give rise to those at the tissue level and beyond. Indeed, the physical properties of tissues vary greatly from the liquid to solid. Very little is known at present on how tissue level properties are related to cell and subcellular properties. Modern measurement techniques provide quantitative results at both the intracellular and tissue level, but not on the connection between these. In the present work we outline a framework to address this connection. We specifically concentrate on the morphogenetic process of tissue fusion, by following the coalescence of two contiguous multicellular aggregates. The time evolution of this process can accurately be described by the theory of viscous liquids. We also study fusion by Monte Carlo simulations and a novel Cellular Particle Dynamics (CPD) model, which is similar to the earlier introduced Subcellular Element Model (SEM; Newman, 2005). Using the combination of experiments, theory and modeling we are able to relate the measured tissue level biophysical quantities to subcellular parameters. Our approach has validity beyond the particular morphogenetic process considered here and provides a general way to relate biophysical properties across scales.},

EVL specification requires cell contact or close cell proximity, because cyt1 is not expressed after explant dissociation. The EVL may be homologous to the Xenopus epithelial layer, including the ventral larval epidermis. While Xenopus epidermal cytokeratin gene expression is activated by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, zebrafish cyt1 is not responsive to BMPs. Zebrafish early gastrula ectodermal explants are specified to express the neural markers opl (zic1) and otx2, and this expression is prevented by BMP4. Dissociation of zebrafish explants prevents otx2 and opl expression, suggesting that neural specification in zebrafish requires cell contact or close cell proximity. This finding is in contrast to the case in Xenopus, where ectodermal dissociation leads to activation of neural gene expression, or autoneuralization. Our data suggest that distinct mechanisms direct development of homologous lineages in different vertebrates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many species form extraembryonic tissues during embryogenesis, such as the placenta of humans and other viviparous mammals. Extraembryonic tissues have various roles in protecting, nourishing and patterning embryos. Prior to gastrulation in zebrafish, the yolk syncytial layer - an extraembryonic nuclear syncytium - produces signals that induce mesoderm and endoderm formation. Mesoderm and endoderm precursor cells are situated in the embryonic margin, an external ring of cells along the embryo-yolk interface. The yolk syncytial layer initially forms below the margin, in a domain called the external yolk syncytial layer (E-YSL). RESULTS: We hypothesize that key components of the yolk syncytial layer's mesoderm and endoderm inducing activity are expressed as mRNAs in the E-YSL. To identify genes expressed in the E-YSL, we used microarrays to compare the transcription profiles of intact pre-gastrula embryos with pre-gastrula embryonic cells that we had separated from the yolk and yolk syncytial layer. This identified a cohort of genes with enriched expression in intact embryos. Here we describe our whole mount in situ hybridization analysis of sixty-eight of them. This includes ten genes with E-YSL expression (camsap1l1, gata3, znf503, hnf1ba, slc26a1, slc40a1, gata6, gpr137bb, otop1 and cebpa), four genes with expression in the enveloping layer (EVL), a superficial epithelium that protects the embryo (zgc:136817, zgc:152778, slc14a2 and elovl6l), three EVL genes whose expression is transiently confined to the animal pole (elovl6l, zgc:136359 and clica), and six genes with transient maternal expression (mtf1, wu:fj59f04, mospd2, rftn2, arrdc1a and pho). We also assessed the requirement of Nodal signaling for the expression of selected genes in the E-YSL, EVL and margin. Margin expression was Nodal dependent for all genes we tested, including the concentrated margin expression of an EVL gene: zgc:110712. All other instances of EVL and E-YSL expression that we tested were Nodal independent. CONCLUSION: We have devised an effective strategy for enriching and identifying genes expressed in the E-YSL of pre-gastrula embryos. To our surprise, maternal genes and genes expressed in the EVL were also enriched by this strategy. A number of these genes are promising candidates for future functional studies on early embryonic patterning.},

abstract = {Source regions for morphogen gradients-organizing regions-can be generated if a local self-enhancing reaction is coupled with a long-ranging reaction that acts antagonistically. Resulting gradients can be translated into patterns of stable gene activities using genes whose products have a positive feedback on the activation on themselves. If several autoregulatory genes compete with each other for activity, cells make an unequivocal choice. Although the signal consists of a smoothly graded distribution, the all-or-nothing response of the cells leads to regions of differently determined cells that are delimited by sharp borders. In some systems, it is not the absolute but the relative level of a gradient that matters. The sequence of head, tentacles, and foot formation in hydra is controlled by a head activation gradient and is an example of this widely used but conceptually rather neglected mode. For subpatterns such as legs and wings, different "compartments" cooperate to produce new signaling substances. Here, morphogen production is restricted to the common borders or where they intersect. The model accounts for the formation of substructures in pairs at the correct positions within the embryo and for the correct orientation and handedness with respect to the main body axes.},

abstract = {Cell generated contractility is a major driver of morphogenesis during processes such as epithelial bending and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions. Previous studies of contraction in embryos have relied on developmentally programmed cell shape changes such as those that accompany ventral furrow formation in Drosophila, bottle cell formation in Xenopus, ingression in amniote embryos, and neurulation in vertebrate embryos. We have identified three methods to reproducibly and acutely induce contraction in embryonic epithelial sheets: laser activation, electrical stimulation, and nano-perfusion with chemicals released by wounding. Contractions induced by all three methods occur over a similar time-scale (1 to 2 min) and lead to reorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton. By combining induced contractions with micro-aspiration we can simultaneously measure the stiffness of the tissue and the force and work done by contractions. Laser activation allows real-time visualization of F-actin remodeling during contraction. Perfusion with cell lysate suggests that these three stimuli activate physiologically relevant pathways that maintain epithelial tension or trigger epithelial morphogenesis. Our methods provide the means to control and study cellular contractility and will allow dissection of molecular mechanisms and biomechanics of cellular contractility.},

abstract = {Rhythmic and sequential subdivision of the elongating vertebrate embryonic body axis into morphological somites is controlled by an oscillating multicellular genetic network termed the segmentation clock. This clock operates in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), generating dynamic stripe patterns of oscillatory gene-expression across the field of PSM cells. How these spatial patterns, the clock's collective period, and the underlying cellular-level interactions are related is not understood. A theory encompassing temporal and spatial domains of local and collective aspects of the system is essential to tackle these questions. Our delayed coupling theory achieves this by representing the PSM as an array of phase oscillators, combining four key elements: a frequency profile of oscillators slowing across the PSM; coupling between neighboring oscillators; delay in coupling; and a moving boundary describing embryonic axis elongation. This theory predicts that the segmentation clock's collective period depends on delayed coupling. We derive an expression for pattern wavelength across the PSM and show how this can be used to fit dynamic wildtype gene-expression patterns, revealing the quantitative values of parameters controlling spatial and temporal organization of the oscillators in the system. Our theory can be used to analyze experimental perturbations, thereby identifying roles of genes involved in segmentation.},

abstract = {Ivan I. Schmalhausen was one of the central figures in the Russian development of the "Modern Synthesis" in evolutionary biology. He is widely cited internationally even today. Schmalhausen developed the main principles of his theory facing the danger of death in the totalitarian Soviet Union. His great services to evolutionary and theoretical biology are indisputable. However, the received view of Schmalhausen's contributions to evolutionary biology makes an unbiased reading of his texts difficult. Here we show that taking all of his works into consideration (including those only available in Russian) paints a much more dynamic and exciting picture of what he tried to achieve. Schmalhausen pioneered the integration of a developmental perspective into evolutionary thinking. A main tool for achieving this was his approach to living objects as complex multi-level self-regulating systems. Schmalhausen put enormous effort into bringing this idea into fruition during the final stages of his career by combining evolutionary theory with cybernetics. His results and ideas remain thought-provoking, and his texts are of more than just historical interest.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Relating features of protein sequences to structural hinges is important for identifying domain boundaries, understanding structure-function relationships, and designing flexibility into proteins. Efforts in this field have been hampered by the lack of a proper dataset for studying characteristics of hinges. RESULTS: Using the Molecular Motions Database we have created a Hinge Atlas of manually annotated hinges and a statistical formalism for calculating the enrichment of various types of residues in these hinges. CONCLUSION: We found various correlations between hinges and sequence features. Some of these are expected; for instance, we found that hinges tend to occur on the surface and in coils and turns and to be enriched with small and hydrophilic residues. Others are less obvious and intuitive. In particular, we found that hinges tend to coincide with active sites, but unlike the latter they are not at all conserved in evolution. We evaluate the potential for hinge prediction based on sequence. Motions play an important role in catalysis and protein-ligand interactions. Hinge bending motions comprise the largest class of known motions. Therefore it is important to relate the hinge location to sequence features such as residue type, physicochemical class, secondary structure, solvent exposure, evolutionary conservation, and proximity to active sites. To do this, we first generated the Hinge Atlas, a set of protein motions with the hinge locations manually annotated, and then studied the coincidence of these features with the hinge location. We found that all of the features have bearing on the hinge location. Most interestingly, we found that hinges tend to occur at or near active sites and yet unlike the latter are not conserved. Less surprisingly, we found that hinge residues tend to be small, not hydrophobic or aliphatic, and occur in turns and random coils on the surface. A functional sequence based hinge predictor was made which uses some of the data generated in this study. The Hinge Atlas is made available to the community for further flexibility studies.},

Although this channel has been well studied for many years, the recent discovery of a high-resolution crystal structure opens up new avenues of exploration. Taking advantage of this, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the translocon in a fully solvated lipid bilayer, examining the translocation abilities of monomeric SecYEbeta by forcing two helices comprised of different amino acid sequences to cross the channel. The simulations revealed that the so-called plug of SecYEbeta swings open during translocation, closing thereafter. Likewise, it was established that the so-called pore ring region of SecYEbeta forms an elastic, yet tight, seal around the translocating oligopeptides. The closed state of the channel was found to block permeation of all ions and water molecules; in the open state, ions were blocked. Our results suggest that the SecYEbeta monomer is capable of forming an active channel.},

abstract = {BAR domains are proteins that sense and sculpt curved membranes in cells, furnishing a relatively well-studied example of mechanisms employed in cellular morphogenesis. We report a computational study of membrane bending by BAR domains at four levels of resolution, described by 1), all-atom molecular dynamics; 2), residue-based coarse-graining (resolving single amino acids and lipid molecules); 3), shape-based coarse-graining (resolving overall protein and membrane shapes); and 4), a continuum elastic membrane model. Membrane sculpting performed by BAR domains collectively is observed in agreement with experiments. Different arrangements of BAR domains on the membrane surface are found to lead to distinct membrane curvatures and bending dynamics.},

abstract = {The cells of many embryonic tissues actively narrow in one dimension (convergence) and lengthen in the perpendicular dimension (extension). Convergence and extension are ubiquitous and important tissue movements in metazoan morphogenesis. In vertebrates, the dorsal axial and paraxial mesodermal tissues, the notochordal and somitic mesoderm, converge and extend. In amphibians as well as a number of other organisms where these movements appear, they occur by mediolateral cell intercalation, the rearrangement of cells along the mediolateral axis to produce an array that is narrower in this axis and longer in the anteroposterior axis. In amphibians, mesodermal cell intercalation is driven by bipolar, mediolaterally directed protrusive activity, which appears to exert traction on adjacent cells and pulls the cells between one another. In addition, the notochordal-somitic boundary functions in convergence and extension by 'capturing' notochordal cells as they contact the boundary, thus elongating the boundary. The prospective neural tissue also actively converges and extends parallel with the mesoderm. In contrast to the mesoderm, cell intercalation in the neural plate normally occurs by monopolar protrusive activity directed medially, towards the midline notoplate-floor-plate region. In contrast, the notoplate-floor-plate region appears to converge and extend by adhering to and being towed by or perhaps migrating on the underlying notochord. Converging and extending mesoderm stiffens by a factor of three or four and exerts up to 0.6 microN force. Therefore, active, force-producing convergent extension, the mechanism of cell intercalation, requires a mechanism to actively pull cells between one another while maintaining a tissue stiffness sufficient to push with a substantial force. Based on the evidence thus far, a cell-cell traction model of intercalation is described. The essential elements of such a morphogenic machine appear to be (i) bipolar, mediolaterally orientated or monopolar, medially directed protrusive activity; (ii) this protrusive activity results in mediolaterally orientated or medially directed traction of cells on one another; (iii) tractive protrusions are confined to the ends of the cells; (iv) a mechanically stable cell cortex over the bulk of the cell body which serves as a movable substratum for the orientated or directed cell traction. The implications of this model for cell adhesion, regulation of cell motility and cell polarity, and cell and tissue biomechanics are discussed.},

abstract = {Cell signalling through Frizzled receptors has evolved to considerable complexity within the metazoans. The Frizzled-dependent signalling cascade comprises several branches, whose differential activation depends on specific Wnt ligands, Frizzled receptor isoforms and the cellular context. In Xenopus laevis embryos, the canonical beta-catenin pathway contributes to the establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis. A different branch, referred to as the planar cell polarity pathway, is essential for cell polarization during elongation of the axial mesoderm by convergent extension. Here we demonstrate that a third branch of the cascade is independent of Dishevelled function and involves signalling through trimeric G proteins and protein kinase C (PKC). During gastrulation, Frizzled-7 (Fz7)-dependent PKC signalling controls cell-sorting behaviour in the mesoderm. Loss of zygotic Fz7 function results in the inability of involuted anterior mesoderm to separate from the ectoderm, which leads to severe gastrulation defects. This result provides a developmentally relevant in vivo function for the Fz/PKC pathway in vertebrates.},

abstract = {Although cell movements are vital for establishing the normal architecture of embryos, it is unclear how these movements are regulated during development in vertebrates. Inhibition of Xenopus Dishevelled (Xdsh) function disrupts convergent extension movements of cells during gastrulation, but the mechanism of this effect is unclear, as cell fates are not affected. In Drosophila, Dishevelled controls both cell fate and cell polarity, but whether Dishevelled is involved in controlling cell polarity in vertebrate embryos has not been investigated. Here we show, using time-lapse confocal microscopy, that the failure of cells lacking Xdsh function to undergo convergent extension results from defects in cell polarity. Furthermore, Xdsh mutations that inhibit convergent extension correspond to mutations in Drosophila Dishevelled that selectively perturb planar cell polarity. Finally, the localization of Xdsh at the membrane of normal dorsal mesodermal cells is consistent with Xdsh controlling cell polarity. Our results show that polarized cell behaviour is essential for convergent extension and is controlled by vertebrate Dishevelled. Thus, a vertebrate equivalent of the Drosophila planar cell polarity signalling cascade may be required for normal gastrulation.},

abstract = {Physically, the course of morphogenesis is determined by the distribution and timing of force production in the embryo and by the mechanical properties of the tissues on which these forces act. We have miniaturized a standard materials-testing procedure (the stress-relaxation test) to measure the viscoelastic properties of the dorsal involuting marginal zone, prechordal mesoderm, and vegetal endoderm of Xenopus laevis embryos during gastrulation. We focused on the involuting marginal zone, because it undergoes convergent extension (an important and wide-spread morphogenetic process) and drives involution, blastopore closure and elongation of the embryonic axis. We show that the involuting marginal zone stiffens during gastrulation, stiffening is a special property of this region rather than a general property of the whole embryo, stiffening is greater along the anteroposterior axis than the mediolateral axis and changes in the cytoskeleton or extracellular matrix are necessary for stiffening, although changes in cell-cell adhesions or cell-matrix adhesions are not ruled out. These findings provide a baseline of data on which future experiments can be designed and make specific, testable predictions about the roles of the cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix and intercellular adhesion in convergent extension, as well as predictions about the morphogenetic role of convergent extension in early development.},

This tissue remodeling requires the correct patterning of gene expression along the A-P axis, perpendicular to the direction of cell movement. Here, we demonstrate that A-P patterning information results in the polarized localization of cortical proteins in intercalating cells. In particular, cell fate differences conferred by striped expression of the even-skipped and runt pair-rule genes are both necessary and sufficient to orient planar polarity. This polarity consists of an enrichment of nonmuscle myosin II at A-P cell borders and Bazooka/PAR-3 protein at the reciprocal D-V cell borders. Moreover, bazooka mutants are defective for germband extension. These results indicate that spatial patterns of gene expression coordinate planar polarity across a multicellular population through the localized distribution of proteins required for cell movement.},

abstract = {Using fate mapping techniques, we have analyzed development of cells of the dorsal marginal region in wild-type and mutant zebrafish. We define a domain in the early gastrula that is located just at the margin and centered on the dorsal midline, in which most cells generate clones that develop exclusively as notochord. The borders of the notochord domain are sharp at the level of single cells, and coincide almost exactly with the border of the expression domain of the homeobox gene floating head (flh; zebrafish homologue of Xnot), a gene essential for notochord development. In flh mutants, cells in the notochord domain generate clones of muscle cells. In contrast, notochord domain cells form mesenchyme in embryos mutant for no tail (ntl; zebrafish homologue of Brachyury). A minority of cells in the notochord domain in wild-type embryos develop as unrestricted mesoderm, invariably located in the tail, suggesting that early gastrula expression of flh does not restrict cellular potential to the notochord fate. The unrestricted tail mesodermal fate is also expressed by the forerunner cells, a cluster of cells located outside the blastoderm, adjacent to the notochord domain. We show that cells can leave the dorsal blastoderm to join the forerunners, suggesting that relocation between fate map domains might respecify notochord domain cells to the tail mesodermal fate. An intermediate fate of the forerunners is to form the epithelial lining of Kupffer's vesicle, a transient structure of the teleost tailbud. The forerunners appear to generate the entire structure of Kupffer's vesicle, which also develops in most flh mutants. Although forerunner cells are present in ntl mutants, Kupffer's vesicle never appears, which is correlated with the later severe disruption of tail development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut formation is a key event during animal development. Recent genetic analysis in chick, mice, and Drosophila has identified Hedgehog and TGFbeta signals as essential players for the development of the primitive gut tube along its anterior-posterior (AP) axis. However, the genetic programs that control gut patterning along its dorsoventral (DV) axis have remained largely elusive. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the activation of the Notch receptor occurs in a single row of boundary cells which separates dorsal from ventral cells in the Drosophila hindgut. rhomboid, which encodes a transmembrane protein, and knirps/knirps-related, which encode nuclear steroid receptors, are Notch target genes required for the expression of crumbs, which encodes a transmembrane protein involved in organizing apical-basal polarity. Notch receptor activation depends on the expression of its ligand Delta in ventral cells, and localizing the Notch receptor to the apical domain of the boundary cells may be required for proper signaling. The analysis of gene expression mediated by a Notch response element suggests that boundary cell-specific expression can be obtained by cooperation of Suppressor of Hairless and the transcription factor Grainyhead or a related factor. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that Notch signaling plays a pivotal role in determining cell fates along the DV axis of the Drosophila hindgut. The finding that Notch signaling results in the expression of an apical polarity organizer which may be required, in turn, for apical Notch receptor localization suggests a simple mechanism by which the specification of a single cell row might be controlled.},

abstract = {Planar polarity is seen in epidermally derived structures throughout the animal kingdom. In the Drosophila eye, planar polarity is reflected in the mirror-symmetric arrangement of ommatidia (eye units) across the dorsoventral midline or equator; ommatidia on the dorsal and ventral sides of the equator exhibit opposite chirality. Photoreceptors R3 and R4 are essential in the establishment of the polarity of ommatidia. The R3 cell is thought to receive the polarizing signal, through the receptor Frizzled (Fz), before or at higher levels then the R4 cell, generating a difference between neighbouring R3 and R4 cells. Both loss-of-function and overexpression of Fz in the R3/R4 pair result in polarity defects and loss of mirror-image symmetry. Here we identify Notch and Delta (Dl) as dominant enhancers of the phenotypes produced by overexpression of fz and dishevelled (dsh), which encodes a signalling component downstream of Fz, and we show that D1-mediated activation of Notch is required for establishment of ommatidial polarity. Whereas fz signalling is required to specify R3, Notch signalling induces the R4 fate. Our data indicate that Dl is a transcriptional target of Fz/Dsh signalling in R3, and activates Notch in the neighbouring R4 precursor. This two-tiered mechanism explains how small differences in the level and/or timing of Fz activation reliably generate a binary cell-fate decision, leading to specification of R3 and R4 and ommatidial chirality.},

abstract = {Similar to chick, mouse, and Xenopus, a number of intercellular signaling pathways are required for zebrafish segmentation. However, the spatial scales over which these signaling pathways operate in zebrafish remain largely unknown. During zebrafish segmentation, waves of her1 transcription (a) initiate within the tailbud region, (b) propagate anteriorly through presomitic mesoderm (PSM), and (c) terminate in the anlage of newly-forming somites. These observations raise the question of whether the tailbud region serves as a "pacemaker" or "organizing center" for the initiation of propagating her1 expression waves. Microsurgical manipulations reveal that the anteriorly waves of her1 transcription are not perturbed by removal of the zebrafish tailbud. Furthermore, expression patterns of deltaD, paraxial protocadherin C (papc), and myoD within recently formed somites also appear to be relatively unperturbed by either removal of the tailbud, or by removal of lateral plate mesoderm. Although dynamic gene networks rapidly specify mesenchymal or epithelial cellular identities within forming somites, this specification is plastic. Time-lapse analysis has shown that the cellular progeny of mitotically-active epithelial border cells within newly formed somites can adopt different cellular identities than their precursor cells. Overall, these results indicate that sustained long-range intercellular communication with the tailbud, anterior somites, or lateral plate mesoderm is not necessary for segmentation or somitogenesis to proceed within the PSM. The basic segmentation and somitogenesis processes in zebrafish presomitic mesoderm appear to be largely regionally autonomous and governed by local morphogenetic cell behaviors.},

It is thought that the mechanical forces arising from compaction of the presumptive internal cells of prospective somites cause them to detach from the unsegmented presomitic mesoderm [1-3]. To determine how prospective somites physically segregate from each other, we used time-lapse microscopy to analyze the mechanics underlying early somitogenesis in wild-type zebrafish and in the mutants trilobite(m209) (tri), knypek(m119) (kny), and kny;tri, which are defective in convergent extension during gastrulation. Formation of somite boundaries in all of these embryos involved segregation, local alignment, and cell-shape changes of presumptive epitheloid border cells along nascent intersomitic boundaries. Although kny;tri somites formed without convergence of the presomitic mesoderm and were composed of only two cells in their anteroposterior (AP) dimension, they still exhibited AP intrasegmental polarity. Furthermore, morphogenesis of somite boundaries in these embryos proceeded in a manner similar to that in wild-type embryos. Thus, intersomitic boundary formation in zebrafish involves short-range movements of presumptive border cells that do not require mechanical forces generated by internal cells or compaction of the presomitic mesoderm.},

abstract = {Drosophila thoracic mechanosensory bristles originate from cells that are singled out from 'proneural' groups of competent epithelial cells. Neural competence is restricted to individual sensory organ precursors (SOPs) by Delta/Notch-mediated 'lateral inhibition', whereas other cells in the proneural field adopt an epidermal fate. The precursors of the large macrochaetes differentiate separately from individual proneural clusters that comprise about 20-30 cells or as heterochronic pairs from groups of more than 100 cells, whereas the precursors of the small regularly spaced microchaetes emerge from even larger proneural fields. This indicates that lateral inhibition might act over several cell diameters; it was difficult to reconcile with the fact that the inhibitory ligand Delta is membrane-bound until the observation that SOPs frequently extend thin processes offered an attractive hypothesis. Here we show that the extension of these planar filopodia--a common attribute of wing imaginal disc cells--is promoted by Delta and that their experimental suppression reduces Notch signalling in distant cells and increases bristle density in large proneural groups, showing that these membrane specializations mediate long-range lateral inhibition.},

abstract = {The small GTPase Ran enzyme regulates critical eukaryotic cellular functions including nuclear transport and mitosis through the creation of a RanGTP gradient around the chromosomes. This concentration gradient is created by the chromatin-bound RCC1 (regulator of chromosome condensation) protein, which recruits Ran to nucleosomes and activates Ran's nucleotide exchange activity. Although RCC1 has been shown to bind directly with the nucleosome, the molecular details of this interaction were not known. Here we determine the crystal structure of a complex of Drosophila RCC1 and the nucleosome core particle at 2.9 A resolution, providing an atomic view of how a chromatin protein interacts with the histone and DNA components of the nucleosome.

It is used to determine the total force exerted on the membrane at each position along the leading edge and at each time step. The model reproduces the marked state switches in protrusion morphodynamics found experimentally between epithelial cells in control conditions and cells expressing constitutively active Rac, a signaling molecule involved in the regulation of lamellipodium network assembly. The model also suggests a mechanistic explanation of experimental distortions in protrusion morphodynamics induced by deregulation of Arp2/3 and cofilin activity.},

Recent experiments suggest that some morphogen gradients may be interpreted prior to reaching steady-state. Theoretical work has predicted that such systems will be more robust to embryo-to-embryo fluctuations. By analyzing two experimentally motivated models of morphogen gradient formation, we investigate the positional precision of gene expression boundaries determined by pre-steady-state morphogen gradients in the presence of embryo-to-embryo fluctuations, internal biochemical noise and variations in the timing of morphogen measurement. Morphogens that are direct transcription factors are found to be particularly sensitive to internal noise when interpreted prior to steady-state, disadvantaging early measurement, even in the presence of large embryo-to-embryo fluctuations. Morphogens interpreted by cell-surface receptors can be measured prior to steady-state without significant decrease in positional precision provided fluctuations in the timing of measurement are small. Applying our results to experiment, we predict that Bicoid, a transcription factor morphogen in Drosophila, is unlikely to be interpreted prior to reaching steady-state. We also predict that Activin in Xenopus and Nodal in zebrafish, morphogens interpreted by cell-surface receptors, can be decoded in pre-steady-state.},

Here, we review the distinct cellular behaviors that define the spatial and temporal patterns of C{\&}E movements, with the special emphasis on zebrafish. We also summarize the molecular regulation of these cellular behaviors and the interplay between different signaling pathways that drive C{\&}E. Finally, to ensure efficient C{\&}E movements, cells must achieve mediolaterally-elongated cell morphology and polarize motile protrusions. We discuss the recent discoveries on the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the mediolateral cell polarity is established.},

To begin to address the role(s) played by Sp2 in early metazoan development we have cloned and characterized Sp2 from zebrafish (Danio rerio). We report that 1) the intron/exon organization and amino acid sequence of zebrafish Sp2 is closely conserved with its mammalian orthologues, 2) zebrafish Sp2 weakly stimulates an Sp-dependent promoter in vitro and associates with the nuclear matrix in a DNA-independent fashion, 3) zebrafish Sp2 is inherited as a maternal transcript, is transcribed in zebrafish embryos and adult tissues, and is required for completion of gastrulation, and 4) zebrafish lines carrying transgenes regulated by the Sp2 promoter recapitulate patterns of endogenous Sp2 expression.},

abstract = {Nociceptive neurons innervate the skin with complex dendritic arbors that respond to pain-evoking stimuli such as harsh mechanical force or extreme temperatures. Here we describe the structure and development of a model nociceptor, the PVD neuron of C. elegans, and identify transcription factors that control morphogenesis of the PVD dendritic arbor. The two PVD neuron cell bodies occupy positions on either the right (PVDR) or left (PVDL) sides of the animal in posterior-lateral locations. Imaging with a GFP reporter revealed a single axon projecting from the PVD soma to the ventral cord and an elaborate, highly branched arbor of dendritic processes that envelop the animal with a web-like array directly beneath the skin. Dendritic branches emerge in a step-wise fashion during larval development and may use an existing network of peripheral nerve cords as guideposts for key branching decisions. Time-lapse imaging revealed that branching is highly dynamic with active extension and withdrawal and that PVD branch overlap is prevented by a contact-dependent self-avoidance, a mechanism that is also employed by sensory neurons in other organisms. With the goal of identifying genes that regulate dendritic morphogenesis, we used the mRNA-tagging method to produce a gene expression profile of PVD during late larval development. This microarray experiment identified>2,000 genes that are 1.5X elevated relative to all larval cells. The enriched transcripts encode a wide range of proteins with potential roles in PVD function (e.g., DEG/ENaC and Trp channels) or development (e.g., UNC-5 and LIN-17/frizzled receptors). We used RNAi and genetic tests to screen 86 transcription factors from this list and identified eleven genes that specify PVD dendritic structure. These transcription factors appear to control discrete steps in PVD morphogenesis and may either promote or limit PVD branching at specific developmental stages. For example, time-lapse imaging revealed that MEC-3 (LIM homeodomain) is required for branch initiation in early larval development whereas EGL-44 (TEAD domain) prevents ectopic PVD branching in the adult. A comparison of PVD-enriched transcripts to a microarray profile of mammalian nociceptors revealed homologous genes with potentially shared nociceptive functions. We conclude that PVD neurons display striking structural, functional and molecular similarities to nociceptive neurons from more complex organisms and can thus provide a useful model system in which to identify evolutionarily conserved determinants of nociceptor fate.},

abstract = {A fundamental issue in cell biology is how migratory cell behaviors are controlled by dynamically regulated cell adhesion. Vertebrate neural crest (NC) cells rapidly alter cadherin expression and localization at the cell surface during migration. Secreted Wnts induce some of these changes in NC adhesion and also promote specification of NC-derived pigment cells. Here, we show that the zebrafish transcription factor Ovo1 is a Wnt target gene that controls migration of pigment precursors by regulating the intracellular movements of N-cadherin (Ncad). Ovo1 genetically interacts with Ncad and its depletion causes Ncad to accumulate inside cells. Ovo1-deficient embryos strongly upregulate factors involved in intracellular trafficking, including several rab GTPases, known to modulate cellular localization of cadherins. Surprisingly, NC cells express high levels of many of these rab genes in the early embryo, chemical inhibitors of Rab functions rescue NC development in Ovo1-deficient embryos and overexpression of a Rab-interacting protein leads to similar defects in NC migration. These results suggest that Ovo proteins link Wnt signaling to intracellular trafficking pathways that localize Ncad in NC cells and allow them to migrate. Similar processes probably occur in other cell types in which Wnt signaling promotes migration.},

abstract = {The B1 SOX transcription factors SOX1/2/3/19 have been implicated in various processes of early embryogenesis. However, their regulatory functions in stages from the blastula to early neurula remain largely unknown, primarily because loss-of-function studies have not been informative to date. In our present study, we systematically knocked down the B1 sox genes in zebrafish. Only the quadruple knockdown of the four B1 sox genes sox2/3/19a/19b resulted in very severe developmental abnormalities, confirming that the B1 sox genes are functionally redundant. We characterized the sox2/3/19a/19b quadruple knockdown embryos in detail by examining the changes in gene expression through in situ hybridization, RT-PCR, and microarray analyses. Importantly, these phenotypic analyses revealed that the B1 SOX proteins regulate the following distinct processes: (1) early dorsoventral patterning by controlling bmp2b/7; (2) gastrulation movements via the regulation of pcdh18a/18b and wnt11, a non-canonical Wnt ligand gene; (3) neural differentiation by regulating the Hes-class bHLH gene her3 and the proneural-class bHLH genes neurog1 (positively) and ascl1a (negatively), and regional transcription factor genes, e.g., hesx1, zic1, and rx3; and (4) neural patterning by regulating signaling pathway genes, cyp26a1 in RA signaling, oep in Nodal signaling, shh, and mdkb. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the her3, hesx1, neurog1, pcdh18a, and cyp26a1 genes further suggests a direct regulation of these genes by B1 SOX. We also found an interesting overlap between the early phenotypes of the B1 sox quadruple knockdown embryos and the maternal-zygotic spg embryos that are devoid of pou5f1 activity. These findings indicate that the B1 SOX proteins control a wide range of developmental regulators in the early embryo through partnering in part with Pou5f1 and possibly with other factors, and suggest that the B1 sox functions are central to coordinating cell fate specification with patterning and morphogenetic processes occurring in the early embryo.},

abstract = {We present nonlinear diffusion equations, numerical schemes to solve them and their application for filtering 3D images obtained from laser scanning microscopy (LSM) of living zebrafish embryos, with a goal to identify the optimal filtering method and its parameters. In the large scale applications dealing with analysis of 3D+time embryogenesis images, an important objective is a correct detection of the number and position of cell nuclei yielding the spatio-temporal cell lineage tree of embryogenesis. The filtering is the first and necessary step of the image analysis chain and must lead to correct results, removing the noise, sharpening the nuclei edges and correcting the acquisition errors related to spuriously connected subregions. In this paper we study such properties for the regularized Perona-Malik model and for the generalized mean curvature flow equations in the level-set formulation. A comparison with other nonlinear diffusion filters, like tensor anisotropic diffusion and Beltrami flow, is also included. All numerical schemes are based on the same discretization principles, i.e. finite volume method in space and semi-implicit scheme in time, for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. These numerical schemes are unconditionally stable, fast and naturally parallelizable. The filtering results are evaluated and compared first using the Mean Hausdorff distance between a gold standard and different isosurfaces of original and filtered data. Then, the number of isosurface connected components in a region of interest (ROI) detected in original and after the filtering is compared with the corresponding correct number of nuclei in the gold standard. Such analysis proves the robustness and reliability of the edge preserving nonlinear diffusion filtering for this type of data and lead to finding the optimal filtering parameters for the studied models and numerical schemes. Further comparisons consist in ability of splitting the very close objects which are artificially connected due to acquisition error intrinsically linked to physics of LSM. In all studied aspects it turned out that the nonlinear diffusion filter which is called geodesic mean curvature flow (GMCF) has the best performance.},

abstract = {The diversity of biological form is generated by a relatively small number of underlying mechanisms. Consequently, mathematical and computational modelling can, and does, provide insight into how cellular level interactions ultimately give rise to higher level structure. Given cells respond to mechanical stimuli, it is therefore important to consider the effects of these responses within biological self-organisation models. Here, we consider the self-organisation properties of a mechanochemical model previously developed by three of the authors in Acta Biomater. 4, 613-621 (2008), which is capable of reproducing the behaviour of a population of cells cultured on an elastic substrate in response to a variety of stimuli. In particular, we examine the conditions under which stable spatial patterns can emerge with this model, focusing on the influence of mechanical stimuli and the interplay of non-local phenomena. To this end, we have performed a linear stability analysis and numerical simulations based on a mixed finite element formulation, which have allowed us to study the dynamical behaviour of the system in terms of the qualitative shape of the dispersion relation. We show that the consideration of mechanotaxis, namely changes in migration speeds and directions in response to mechanical stimuli alters the conditions for pattern formation in a singular manner. Furthermore without non-local effects, responses to mechanical stimuli are observed to result in dispersion relations with positive growth rates at arbitrarily large wavenumbers, in turn yielding heterogeneity at the cellular level in model predictions. This highlights the sensitivity and necessity of non-local effects in mechanically influenced biological pattern formation models and the ultimate failure of the continuum approximation in their absence.},

abstract = {The ABC model postulates that expression combinations of three classes of genes (A, B and C) specify the four floral organs at early stages of flower development. This classic model provides a solid framework to study flower development and has been the foundation for multiple studies in different plant species, as well as for new evolutionary hypotheses. Nevertheless, it has been shown that in spite of being necessary, these three gene classes are not sufficient for flower organ specification. Rather, flower organ specification depends on complex interactions of several genes, and probably other non-genetic factors. Being useful to study systems of complex interactions, mathematical and computational models have enlightened the origin of the A, B and C stereotyped and robust expression patterns and the process of early flower morphogenesis. Here, we present a brief introduction to basic modeling concepts and techniques and review the results that these models have rendered for the particular case of the Arabidopsis thaliana flower organ specification. One of the main results is the uncovering of a robust functional module that is sufficient to recover the gene configurations characterizing flower organ primordia. Another key result is that the temporal sequence with which such gene configurations are attained may be recovered only by modeling the aforementioned functional module as a noisy or stochastic system. Finally, modeling approaches enable testable predictions regarding the role of non-genetic factors (noise, mechano-elastic forces, etc.) in development. These predictions, along with some perspectives for future work, are also reviewed and discussed.},

abstract = {In vertebrates, canonical Wnt signaling controls posterior neural cell lineage specification. Although Wnt signaling to the neural plate is sufficient for posterior identity, the source and timing of this activity remain uncertain. Furthermore, crucial molecular targets of this activity have not been defined. Here, we identify the endogenous Wnt activity and its role in controlling an essential downstream transcription factor, Meis3. Wnt3a is expressed in a specialized mesodermal domain, the paraxial dorsolateral mesoderm, which signals to overlying neuroectoderm. Loss of zygotic Wnt3a in this region does not alter mesoderm cell fates, but blocks Meis3 expression in the neuroectoderm, triggering the loss of posterior neural fates. Ectopic Meis3 protein expression is sufficient to rescue this phenotype. Moreover, Wnt3a induction of the posterior nervous system requires functional Meis3 in the neural plate. Using ChIP and promoter analysis, we show that Meis3 is a direct target of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. This suggests a new model for neural anteroposterior patterning, in which Wnt3a from the paraxial mesoderm induces posterior cell fates via direct activation of a crucial transcription factor in the overlying neural plate.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In early vertebrate development, embryonic tissues modulate cell adhesiveness and acto-myosin contractility to correctly orchestrate the complex processes of gastrulation. E-cadherin (E-cadh) is the earliest expressed cadherin and is needed in the mesendodermal progenitors for efficient migration. Regulatory mechanisms involving directed E-cadh trafficking have been invoked downstream of Wnt11/5 signaling. This non-canonical Wnt pathway regulates RhoA-ROK/DAAM1 to control the acto-myosin network. However, in this context nothing is known of the intracellular signals that participate in the correct localization of E-cadh, other than a need for Rab5c signaling. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By studying loss of Chp induced by morpholino-oligonucleotide injection in zebrafish, we find that the vertebrate atypical Rho-GTPase Chp is essential for the proper disposition of cells in the early embryo. The underlying defect is not leading edge F-actin assembly (prominent in the cells of the envelope layer), but rather the failure to localize E-cadh and beta-catenin at the adherens junctions. Loss of Chp results in delayed epiboly that can be rescued by mRNA co-injection, and phenocopies zebrafish E-cadh mutants. This new signaling pathway involves activation of an effector kinase PAK, and involvement of the adaptor PAK-interacting exchange factor PIX. Loss of signaling by any of the three components results in similar underlying defects, which is most prominent in the epithelial-like envelope layer. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our current study uncovers a developmental pathway involving Chp/PAK/PIX signaling, which helps co-ordinate E-cadh disposition to promote proper cell adhesiveness, and coordinate movements of the three major cell layers in epiboly. Our data shows that without Chp signaling, E-cadh shifts to intracellular vesicles rather than the adhesive contacts needed for directed cell movement. These events may mirror the requirement for PAK2 signaling essential for the proper formation of the blood-brain barrier.},

abstract = {Cytosine DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark present in many eukaryotic organisms. Although DNA methylation likely has a conserved role in gene silencing, the levels and patterns of DNA methylation appear to vary drastically among different organisms. Here we used shotgun genomic bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) to compare DNA methylation in eight diverse plant and animal genomes. We found that patterns of methylation are very similar in flowering plants with methylated cytosines detected in all sequence contexts, whereas CG methylation predominates in animals. Vertebrates have methylation throughout the genome except for CpG islands. Gene body methylation is conserved with clear preference for exons in most organisms. Furthermore, genes appear to be the major target of methylation in Ciona and honey bee. Among the eight organisms, the green alga Chlamydomonas has the most unusual pattern of methylation, having non-CG methylation enriched in exons of genes rather than in repeats and transposons. In addition, the Dnmt1 cofactor Uhrf1 has a conserved function in maintaining CG methylation in both transposons and gene bodies in the mouse, Arabidopsis, and zebrafish genomes.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal periodicity of somite formation is controlled by the segmentation clock, in which numerous cells cyclically express hairy-related transcriptional repressors with a posterior-to-anterior phase delay, creating 'traveling waves' of her1 expression. In zebrafish, the first traveling wave buds off from the synchronous oscillation zone in the blastoderm margin. Here we show that the emergence of a traveling wave coincides with the anterior expansion of Fgf signaling and that transplanted Fgf8b-soaked beads induce ectopic traveling waves. We thus propose that as development proceeds, the activity of Fgf signaling gradually expands anteriorly, starting from the margin, so that cells initiate her1 oscillation with a posterior-to-anterior phase delay. Furthermore, we suggest that Fgf has an essential role in establishing the period gradient that is required for the her1 spatial oscillation pattern at the emergence of the traveling wave.},

During Drosophila mesoderm invagination, pulsed actomyosin meshwork contractions and a ratchet-like stabilization of cell shape drive apical constriction. Here, we investigate how contractile forces are integrated across the tissue. Reducing adherens junction (AJ) levels or ablating actomyosin meshworks causes tissue-wide epithelial tears, which release tension that is predominantly oriented along the anterior-posterior (a-p) embryonic axis. Epithelial tears allow cells normally elongated along the a-p axis to constrict isotropically, which suggests that apical constriction generates anisotropic epithelial tension that feeds back to control cell shape. Epithelial tension requires the transcription factor Twist, which stabilizes apical myosin II, promoting the formation of a supracellular actomyosin meshwork in which radial actomyosin fibers are joined end-to-end at spot AJs. Thus, pulsed actomyosin contractions require a supracellular, tensile meshwork to transmit cellular forces to the tissue level during morphogenesis.},

abstract = {Establishment of the embryonic mesoderm is dependent on integration of multiple signaling and transcriptional inputs. We report that the transcriptional regulator Foxd3 is essential for dorsal mesoderm formation in zebrafish, and that this function is dependent on the Nodal pathway. Foxd3 gain-of-function results in expanded dorsal mesodermal gene expression, including the Nodal-related gene cyclops, and body axis dorsalization. Foxd3 knockdown embryos displayed reduced expression of cyclops and mesodermal genes, axial defects similar to Nodal pathway loss-of-function, and Nodal pathway activation rescued these phenotypes. In MZoep mutants inactive for Nodal signaling, Foxd3 did not rescue mesoderm formation or axial development, indicating that the mesodermal function of Foxd3 is dependent on an active downstream Nodal pathway. A previously identified foxd3 mutant, sym1, was described as a predicted null mutation with neural crest defects, but no mesodermal or axial phenotypes. We find that Sym1 protein retains activity and can induce strong mesodermal expansion and axial dorsalization. A subset of sym1 homozygotes displays axial defects and reduced cyclops and mesodermal gene expression, and penetrance of the mesodermal phenotypes is enhanced by Foxd3 knockdown. Therefore, sym1 is a hypomorphic allele, and reduced Foxd3 function results in a reduction of cyclops expression, and subsequent mesodermal and axial defects. These results demonstrate that Foxd3 is an essential upstream regulator of the Nodal pathway in zebrafish dorsal mesoderm development and establish a broadly conserved role for Foxd3 in vertebrate mesodermal development.},

abstract = {After fertilization the embryonic genome is inactive until transcription is initiated during the maternal-zygotic transition. This transition coincides with the formation of pluripotent cells, which in mammals can be used to generate embryonic stem cells. To study the changes in chromatin structure that accompany pluripotency and genome activation, we mapped the genomic locations of histone H3 molecules bearing lysine trimethylation modifications before and after the maternal-zygotic transition in zebrafish. Histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which is repressive, and H3K4me3, which is activating, were not detected before the transition. After genome activation, more than 80% of genes were marked by H3K4me3, including many inactive developmental regulatory genes that were also marked by H3K27me3. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the same promoter regions had both trimethylation marks. Such bivalent chromatin domains also exist in embryonic stem cells and are thought to poise genes for activation while keeping them repressed. Furthermore, we found many inactive genes that were uniquely marked by H3K4me3. Despite this activating modification, these monovalent genes were neither expressed nor stably bound by RNA polymerase II. Inspection of published data sets revealed similar monovalent domains in embryonic stem cells. Moreover, H3K4me3 marks could form in the absence of both sequence-specific transcriptional activators and stable association of RNA polymerase II, as indicated by the analysis of an inducible transgene. These results indicate that bivalent and monovalent domains might poise embryonic genes for activation and that the chromatin profile associated with pluripotency is established during the maternal-zygotic transition.},

Little is known about epigenetic states in the developing zebrafish, despite its importance as a model organism. We report here DNA methylation and histone modification profiles of promoters of developmentally-regulated genes (pou5f1, sox2, sox3, klf4, nnr, otx1b, nes, vasa), as well as tert and bactin2, in zebrafish embryos at the mid-late blastula transition, shortly after embryonic genome activation. We identify four classes of promoters based on the following profiles: (i) those enriched in marks of active genes (H3K9ac, H4ac, H3K4me3) without transcriptionally repressing H3K9me3 or H3K27me3; (ii) those enriched in H3K9ac, H4ac and H3K27me3, without H3K9me3; one such gene was klf4, shown by in situ hybridization to be mosaically expressed, likely accounting for the detection of both activating and repressive marks on its promoter; (iii) those enriched in H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 without acetylation; and (iv) those enriched in all histone modifications examined. Culture of embryo-derived cells under differentiation conditions leads to H3K9 and H4 deacetylation and H3K9 and H3K27 trimethylation on genes that are inactivated, yielding an epigenetic profile similar to those of fibroblasts or muscle. All promoters however retain H3K4me3, indicating an uncoupling of H3K4me3 occupancy and gene expression. All non-CpG island developmentally-regulated promoters are DNA unmethylated in embryos, but hypermethylated in fibroblasts. Our results suggest that differentially expressed embryonic genes are regulated by various patterns of histone modifications on unmethylated DNA, which create a developmentally permissive chromatin state.},

abstract = {During early zebrafish development the nodal signalling pathway patterns the embryo into three germ layers, in part by inducing the expression of no tail (ntl), which is essential for correct mesoderm formation. When nodal signalling is inhibited ntl fails to be expressed in the dorsal margin, but ventral ntl expression is unaffected. These observations indicate that ntl transcription is under both nodal-dependent and nodal-independent regulation. Consistent with these observations and with a role for ntl in mesoderm formation, some somites form within the tail region of embryos lacking nodal signalling. In an effort to understand how ntl is regulated and thus how mesoderm forms, we have mapped the elements responsible for nodal-dependent and nodal-independent expression of ntl in the margin of the embryo. Our work demonstrates that expression of ntl in the margin is the consequence of two separate enhancers, which act to mediate different mechanisms of mesoderm formation. One of these enhancers responds to nodal signalling, and the other to Wnt and BMP signalling. We demonstrate that the nodal-independent regulation of ntl is essential for tail formation. Misexpression of Wnt and BMP ligands can induce the formation of an ectopic tail, which contains somites, in embryos devoid of nodal signalling, and this tail formation is dependent on ntl function. Similarly, nodal-independent tail somite formation requires ntl. At later stages in development ntl is required for notochord formation, and our analysis has also led to the identification of the enhancer required for ntl expression in the developing notochord.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tissue morphogenesis is a complex process whereby tissue structures self-assemble by the aggregate behaviors of independently acting cells responding to both intracellular and extracellular cues in their environment. During embryonic development, morphogenesis is particularly important for organizing cells into tissues, and although key regulatory events of this process are well studied in isolation, a number of important systems-level questions remain unanswered. This is due, in part, to a lack of integrative tools that enable the coupling of biological phenomena across spatial and temporal scales. Here, we present a new computational framework that integrates intracellular signaling information with multi-cell behaviors in the context of a spatially heterogeneous tissue environment.

RESULTS: We have developed a computational simulation of mesendoderm migration in the Xenopus laevis explant model, which is a well studied biological model of tissue morphogenesis that recapitulates many features of this process during development in humans. The simulation couples, via a JAVA interface, an ordinary differential equation-based mass action kinetics model to compute intracellular Wnt/beta-catenin signaling with an agent-based model of mesendoderm migration across a fibronectin extracellular matrix substrate. The emergent cell behaviors in the simulation suggest the following properties of the system: maintaining the integrity of cell-to-cell contact signals is necessary for preventing fractionation of cells as they move, contact with the Fn substrate and the existence of a Fn gradient provides an extracellular feedback loop that governs migration speed, the incorporation of polarity signals is required for cells to migrate in the same direction, and a delicate balance of integrin and cadherin interactions is needed to reproduce experimentally observed migratory behaviors.

CONCLUSION: Our computational framework couples two different spatial scales in biology: intracellular with multicellular. In our simulation, events at one scale have quantitative and dynamic impact on events at the other scale. This integration enables the testing and identification of key systems-level hypotheses regarding how signaling proteins affect overall tissue-level behavior during morphogenesis in an experimentally verifiable system. Applications of this approach extend to the study of tissue patterning processes that occur during adulthood and disease, such as tumorgenesis and atherogenesis.},

abstract = {Laser scanning microscopy provides high-resolution nondestructive in vivo imaging to capture specific structures that have been fluorescently labeled, such as cellular nuclei and membranes, throughout early zebrafish embryogenesis. An increasingly challenging problem biologists must face is how to effectively explore, follow, and study the thousands of cells contained in the resulting time-varying volume data that are large in space, time, and variable domain. Visual data explorations, such as direct volume rendering, have been successfully used for the analysis of volumetric data. However, visualizing large-scale time-varying fields remains a challenging problem. In this paper we present a novel Focus+Context animated volume rendering. The technique is based on the distance map of objects of interest and on a scene graph architecture. We demonstrate that distance map driven volume rendering, implemented in modern graphics hardware, is suited to generate run time and interactive representations such as ghosted rendering and cut-away rendering. The experimental results on zebrafish embryogenesis data demonstrate that the technique is suited to uncover and to analyze biological events, such as organogenesis, contained in time-varying volumetric dataset.},

abstract = {Together with cell growth, division and death, changes in cell shape are of central importance for tissue morphogenesis during development. Cell shape is the product of a cell's material and active properties balanced by external forces. Control of cell shape, therefore, relies on both tight regulation of intracellular mechanics and the cell's physical interaction with its environment. In this review, we first discuss the biological and physical mechanisms of cell shape control. We next examine a number of developmental processes in which cell shape change - either individually or in a coordinated manner - drives embryonic morphogenesis and discuss how cell shape is controlled in these processes. Finally, we emphasize that cell shape control during tissue morphogenesis can only be fully understood by using a combination of cellular, molecular, developmental and biophysical approaches.},

abstract = {In amphibian and teleost embryos, the dorsal determinants (DDs) are believed to be initially localized to the vegetal pole and then transported to the prospective dorsal side of the embryo along a microtubule array. The DDs are known to activate the canonical Wnt pathway and thereby promote the expression of genes that induce the dorsal organizer. Here, by identifying the locus of the maternal-effect ventralized mutant tokkaebi, we show that Syntabulin, a linker of the kinesin I motor protein, is essential for dorsal determination in zebrafish. We found that syntabulin mRNA is transported to the vegetal pole during oogenesis through the Bucky ball (Buc)-mediated Balbiani body-dependent pathway, which is necessary for establishment of animal-vegetal (AV) oocyte polarity. We demonstrate that Syntabulin is translocated from the vegetal pole in a microtubule-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that Syntabulin regulates the microtubule-dependent transport of the DDs, and provide evidence for the link between AV and dorsoventral axis formation.},

To augment current neurobiological research, we have developed the first three-dimensional digital atlas of the zebrafish brain from T2-weighted magnetic resonance histology (MRH) images acquired on a 16.4-T superconducting magnet. We achieved an isotropic resolution of 10 microm, which is the highest resolution achieved in a vertebrate brain and, for the first time, is comparable in slice thickness to conventional histology. By using manual segmentation, 53 anatomical structures, including fiber tracts as small as 40 microm, were delineated. Using Amira software, structures were also individually segmented and reconstructed to create three-dimensional animations. Additional quantitative information including, volume, surface areas, and mean gray scale intensities were also determined. Finally, we established a stereotaxic coordinate system as a framework in which maps created from other modalities can be incorporated into the atlas.},

abstract = {Morphogenesis in plants arises from the interplay of genetic and physical interactions within a growing network of cells. The physical aspects of cell proliferation and differentiation are genetically regulated, but constrained by mechanical interactions between the cells. Higher plant tissues consist of an elaborate three-dimensional matrix of active cytoplasm and extracellular matrix, where it is difficult to obtain direct measurements of geometry or cell interactions. To properly understand the workings of plant morphogenesis, it is necessary to have biological systems that allow simple and direct observation of these processes. We have adopted a highly simplified plant system to investigate how cell proliferation and expansion is coordinated during morphogenesis. Coleocheate scutata is a microscopic fresh-water green alga with simple anatomical features that allow for accurate quantification of morphogenetic processes. Image analysis techniques were used to extract precise models for cell geometry and physical parameters for growth. This allowed construction of a deformable finite element model for growth of the whole organism, which incorporated cell biophysical properties, viscous expansion of cell walls, and rules for regulation of cell behavior. The study showed that a simple set of autonomous, cell-based rules are sufficient to account for the morphological and dynamic properties of Coleochaete growth. A variety of morphogenetic behavior emerged from the application of these local rules. Cell shape sensing is sufficient to explain the patterns of cell division during growth. This simplifying principle is likely to have application in modeling and design for engineering of higher plant tissues.},

abstract = {Most animals display internal and/or external left-right asymmetry. Several mechanisms for left-right asymmetry determination have been proposed for vertebrates and invertebrates but they are still not well characterized, particularly at the early developmental stage. The gastropods Lymnaea stagnalis and the closely related Lymnaea peregra have both the sinistral (recessive) and the dextral (dominant) snails within a species and the chirality is hereditary, determined by a single locus that functions maternally. Intriguingly, the handedness-determining gene(s) and the mechanisms are not yet identified. Here we show that in L. stagnalis, the chiral blastomere arrangement at the eight-cell stage (but not the two- or four-cell stage) determines the left-right asymmetry throughout the developmental programme, and acts upstream of the Nodal signalling pathway. Thus, we could demonstrate that mechanical micromanipulation of the third cleavage chirality (from the four- to the eight-cell stage) leads to reversal of embryonic handedness. These manipulated embryos grew to 'dextralized' sinistral and 'sinistralized' dextral snails-that is, normal healthy fertile organisms with all the usual left-right asymmetries reversed to that encoded by the mothers' genetic information. Moreover, manipulation reversed the embryonic nodal expression patterns. Using backcrossed F(7) congenic animals, we could demonstrate a strong genetic linkage between the handedness-determining gene(s) and the chiral cytoskeletal dynamics at the third cleavage that promotes the dominant-type blastomere arrangement. These results establish the crucial importance of the maternally determined blastomere arrangement at the eight-cell stage in dictating zygotic signalling pathways in the organismal chiromorphogenesis. Similar chiral blastomere configuration mechanisms may also operate upstream of the Nodal pathway in left-right patterning of deuterostomes/vertebrates.},

We designed a framework for imaging and reconstructing unstained whole zebrafish embryos for their first 10 cell division cycles and report measurements along the cell lineage with micrometer spatial resolution and minute temporal accuracy. Point-scanning multiphoton excitation optimized to preferentially probe the innermost regions of the embryo provided intrinsic signals highlighting all mitotic spindles and cell boundaries. Automated image analysis revealed the phenomenology of cell proliferation. Blastomeres continuously drift out of synchrony. After the 32-cell stage, the cell cycle lengthens according to cell radial position, leading to apparent division waves. Progressive amplification of this process is the rule, contrasting with classical descriptions of abrupt changes in the system dynamics.},

Early zebrafish development can be captured by standard light-sheet microscopy, but new imaging strategies are required to obtain high-quality data of late development or of less transparent organisms. We combined digital scanned laser light-sheet fluorescence microscopy with incoherent structured-illumination microscopy (DSLM-SI) and created structured-illumination patterns with continuously adjustable frequencies. Our method discriminates the specimen-related scattered background from signal fluorescence, thereby removing out-of-focus light and optimizing the contrast of in-focus structures. DSLM-SI provides rapid control of the illumination pattern, exceptional imaging quality and high imaging speeds. We performed long-term imaging of zebrafish development for 58 h and fast multiple-view imaging of early Drosophila melanogaster development. We reconstructed cell positions over time from the Drosophila DSLM-SI data and created a fly digital embryo.},

abstract = {Somitogenesis is a process common to all vertebrate embryos in which repeated blocks of cells arise from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) to lay a foundational pattern for trunk and tail development. Somites form in the wake of passing waves of periodic gene expression that originate in the tailbud and sweep posteriorly across the PSM. Previous work has suggested that the waves result from a spatiotemporally graded control protein that affects the oscillation rate of clock-gene expression. With a minimally constructed mathematical model, we study the contribution of two control mechanisms to the initial formation of this gene-expression wave. We test four biologically motivated model scenarios with either one or two clock protein transcription binding sites, and with or without differential decay rates for clock protein monomers and dimers. We examine the sensitivity of wave formation with respect to multiple model parameters and robustness to heterogeneity in cell population. We find that only a model with both multiple binding sites and differential decay rates is able to reproduce experimentally observed waveforms. Our results show that the experimentally observed characteristics of somitogenesis wave initiation constrain the underlying genetic control mechanisms.},

abstract = {In the course of animal morphogenesis, large-scale cell movements occur, which involve the rearrangement, mutual spreading, and compartmentalization of cell populations in specific configurations. Morphogenetic cell rearrangements such as cell sorting and mutual tissue spreading have been compared with the behaviors of immiscible liquids, which they closely resemble. Based on this similarity, it has been proposed that tissues behave as liquids and possess a characteristic surface tension, which arises as a collective, macroscopic property of groups of mobile, cohering cells. But how are tissue surface tensions generated? Different theories have been proposed to explain how mesoscopic cell properties such as cell-cell adhesion and contractility of cell interfaces may underlie tissue surface tensions. Although recent work suggests that both may be contributors, an explicit model for the dependence of tissue surface tension on these mesoscopic parameters has been missing. Here we show explicitly that the ratio of adhesion to cortical tension determines tissue surface tension. Our minimal model successfully explains the available experimental data and makes predictions, based on the feedback between mechanical energy and geometry, about the shapes of aggregate surface cells, which we verify experimentally. This model indicates that there is a crossover from adhesion dominated to cortical-tension dominated behavior as a function of the ratio between these two quantities.},

abstract = {Formation of the organizer is one of the most central patterning events in vertebrate development. Organizer-derived signals are responsible for establishing the CNS and patterning the dorsal ventral axis. The mechanisms promoting organizer formation are known to involve cooperation between Nodal and Wnt signalling. However, the organizer forms in a very restricted region, suggesting the presence of mechanisms that repress its formation. Here, we show in zebrafish that the transcription factor Sox3 represses multiple steps in the signalling events that lead to organizer formation. Although beta-catenin, Bozozok and Squint are known to play major roles in establishing the dorsal organizer in vertebrate embryos, overexpression of any of these is insufficient to induce robust expression of markers of the organizer in ectopic positions in the animal pole, where Sox3 is strongly expressed. We show that a dominant-negative nuclear localisation mutant of Sox3 can cause ectopic expression of organizer genes via a mechanism that activates all of these earlier factors, resulting in later axis duplication including major bifurcations of the CNS. We also find that the related SoxB1 factor, Sox19b, can act redundantly with Sox3 in these effects. It therefore seems that the broad expression of these SoxB1 genes throughout the early epiblast and their subsequent restriction to the ectoderm is a primary regulator of when and where the organizer forms.},

abstract = {During morphogenesis, forces generated by cells are coordinated and channeled by the viscoelastic properties of the embryo. Microtubules and F-actin are considered to be two of the most important structural elements within living cells accounting for both force production and mechanical stiffness. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of microtubules to the stiffness of converging and extending dorsal tissues in Xenopus laevis embryos using cell biological, biophysical and embryological techniques. Surprisingly, we discovered that depolymerizing microtubules stiffens embryonic tissues by three- to fourfold. We attribute tissue stiffening to Xlfc, a previously identified RhoGEF, which binds microtubules and regulates the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Combining drug treatments and Xlfc activation and knockdown lead us to the conclusion that mechanical properties of tissues such as viscoelasticity can be regulated through RhoGTPase pathways and rule out a direct contribution of microtubules to tissue stiffness in the frog embryo. We can rescue nocodazole-induced stiffening with drugs that reduce actomyosin contractility and can partially rescue morphogenetic defects that affect stiffened embryos. We support these conclusions with a multi-scale analysis of cytoskeletal dynamics, tissue-scale traction and measurements of tissue stiffness to separate the role of microtubules from RhoGEF activation. These findings suggest a re-evaluation of the effects of nocodazole and increased focus on the role of Rho family GTPases as regulators of the mechanical properties of cells and their mechanical interactions with surrounding tissues.},

abstract = {A species-specific number of segments is a hallmark of the vertebrate body plan. The first segmental structures in the vertebrate embryo are the somites, which bud sequentially from the growing presomitic mesoderm (PSM). The Clock and Wavefront model for somitogenesis proposes that the total number of somites is determined by the period of an oscillator or clock operating in the PSM and the total duration of PSM growth. Furthermore, the number of oscillations of the segmentation clock has been suggested to regulate the regional identity of segments along the body axis. Here we test these two ideas in a zebrafish mutant in which the segmentation clock is specifically slowed. This reduces segment number as predicted, but hox gene expression and posterior anatomical markers align with lower segmental counts in mutants compared to the wild-type, arguing against an instructive role of the segmentation clock in determining axial identities. Our data therefore suggest that precise control of segmentation clock period in relation to axial growth ensures a species-specific segment number and that during evolution modulating the clock's period through genetic mutations may have been a relevant way to vary segment number independently of axial regionalization.},

Movement coordination between the YSL and blastoderm cells is dependent on contact between these tissues, and is probably required for the patterning and morphogenetic function of the YSL. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the YSL morphogenesis and movement coordination between the YSL and blastoderm during early development.},

We show by live imaging and lineage tracing in different vertebrate models that the lateral plate contributes mesoderm to the early limb bud through directional cell movement. The direction of cell motion, longitudinal cell axes and bias in cell division planes lie largely parallel to one another along the rostrocaudal (head-tail) axis in lateral plate mesoderm. Transition of these parameters from a rostrocaudal to a mediolateral (outward from the body wall) orientation accompanies early limb bud outgrowth. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Wnt5a acts as a chemoattractant in the emerging limb bud where it contributes to the establishment of cell polarity that is likely to underlie the oriented cell behaviours.},

In vertebrates, the first morphological asymmetry in the oocyte is the Balbiani body, a highly conserved, transient structure found in vertebrates and invertebrates including Drosophila, Xenopus, human, and mouse. We report the identification of the zebrafish magellan (mgn) mutant, which exhibits a novel enlarged Balbiani body phenotype and a disruption of oocyte polarity. To determine the molecular identity of the mgn gene, we positionally cloned the gene, employing a novel DNA capture method to target region-specific genomic DNA of 600 kb for massively parallel sequencing. Using this technique, we were able to enrich for the genomic region linked to our mutation within one week and then identify the mutation in mgn using massively parallel sequencing. This is one of the first successful uses of genomic DNA enrichment combined with massively parallel sequencing to determine the molecular identity of a gene associated with a mutant phenotype. We anticipate that the combination of these technologies will have wide applicability for the efficient identification of mutant genes in all organisms. We identified the mutation in mgn as a deletion in the coding sequence of the zebrafish microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 (macf1) gene. macf1 is a member of the highly conserved spectraplakin family of cytoskeletal linker proteins, which play diverse roles in polarized cells such as neurons, muscle cells, and epithelial cells. In mgn mutants, the oocyte nucleus is mislocalized; and the Balbiani body, localized mRNAs, and organelles are absent from the periphery of the oocyte, consistent with a function for macf1 in nuclear anchoring and cortical localization. These data provide the first evidence for a role for spectraplakins in polarization of the vertebrate oocyte and egg.},

abstract = {Planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins form polarized cortical domains that govern polarity of external structures such as hairs and cilia in both vertebrate and invertebrate epithelia. The mechanisms that globally orient planar polarity are not understood, and are investigated here in the Drosophila wing using a combination of experiment and theory. Planar polarity arises during growth and PCP domains are initially oriented toward the well-characterized organizer regions that control growth and patterning. At pupal stages, the wing hinge contracts, subjecting wing-blade epithelial cells to anisotropic tension in the proximal-distal axis. This results in precise patterns of oriented cell elongation, cell rearrangement and cell division that elongate the blade proximo-distally and realign planar polarity with the proximal-distal axis. Mutation of the atypical Cadherin Dachsous perturbs the global polarity pattern by altering epithelial dynamics. This mechanism utilizes the cellular movements that sculpt tissues to align planar polarity with tissue shape.},

abstract = {Living cells adapt to the stiffness of their environment. However, cell response to stiffness is mainly thought to be initiated by the deformation of adhesion complexes under applied force. In order to determine whether cell response was triggered by stiffness or force, we have developed a unique method allowing us to tune, in real time, the effective stiffness experienced by a single living cell in a uniaxial traction geometry. In these conditions, the rate of traction force buildup dF/dt was adapted to stiffness in less than 0.1 s. This integrated fast response was unambiguously triggered by stiffness, and not by force. It suggests that early cell response could be mechanical in nature. In fact, local force-dependent signaling through adhesion complexes could be triggered and coordinated by the instantaneous cell-scale adaptation of dF/dt to stiffness. Remarkably, the effective stiffness method presented here can be implemented on any mechanical setup. Thus, beyond single-cell mechanosensing, this method should be useful to determine the role of rigidity in many fundamental phenomena such as morphogenesis and development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A complex network of signaling pathways and transcription factors regulates vertebrate mesoderm development. Zebrafish mutants provide a powerful tool for examining the roles of individual genes in such a network. spadetail (spt) is a mutant with a lesion in tbx16, a T-box transcription factor involved in mesoderm development; the mutant phenotype includes disrupted primitive red blood cell formation as well as disrupted somitogenesis. Despite much recent progress, the downstream targets of tbx16 remain incompletely understood. The current study was carried out to test whether any of the five major signaling pathways are regulated by tbx16 during two specific stages of mesoderm development: primitive red blood cell formation in the intermediate mesoderm and somite formation in the tail paraxial mesoderm. This test was performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, which identifies coordinated changes in expression among a priori sets of genes associated with biological features or processes. RESULTS: Our Gene Set Enrichment Analysis results identify Wnt and retinoic acid signaling as likely downstream targets of tbx16 in the developing zebrafish intermediate mesoderm, the site of primitive red blood cell formation. In addition, such results identify retinoic acid signaling as a downstream target of tbx16 in the developing zebrafish posterior somites. Finally, using candidate gene identification and in situ hybridization, we provide expression domain information for 25 additional genes downstream of tbx16 that are outside of both pathways; 23 were previously unknown downstream targets of tbx16, and seven had previously uncharacterized expression in zebrafish. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that (1) tbx16 regulates Wnt signaling in the developing zebrafish intermediate mesoderm, the site of primitive red blood cell formation, and (2) tbx16 regulates retinoic acid signaling at two distinct embryonic locations and developmental stages, which may imply ongoing spatio-temporal regulation throughout mesoderm development.},

abstract = {Organ formation requires the precise assembly of progenitor cells into a functional multicellular structure. Mechanical forces probably participate in this process but how they influence organ morphogenesis is still unclear. Here, we show that Wnt11- and Prickle1a-mediated planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling coordinates the formation of the zebrafish ciliated laterality organ (Kupffer's vesicle) by regulating adhesion properties between organ progenitor cells (the dorsal forerunner cells, DFCs). Combined inhibition of Wnt11 and Prickle1a reduces DFC cell-cell adhesion and impairs their compaction and arrangement during vesicle lumen formation. This leads to the formation of a mis-shapen vesicle with small fragmented lumina and shortened cilia, resulting in severely impaired organ function and, as a consequence, randomised laterality of both molecular and visceral asymmetries. Our results reveal a novel role for PCP-dependent cell adhesion in coordinating the supracellular organisation of progenitor cells during vertebrate laterality organ formation.},

abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy has profoundly changed cell and molecular biology studies by permitting tagged gene products to be followed as they function and interact. The ability of a fluorescent dye to absorb and emit light of different wavelengths allows it to generate startling contrast that, in the best cases, can permit single molecule detection and tracking. However, in many experimental settings, fluorescent probes fall short of their potential due to dye bleaching, dye signal saturation, and tissue autofluorescence. Here, we demonstrate that second harmonic generating (SHG) nanoprobes can be used for in vivo imaging, circumventing many of the limitations of classical fluorescence probes. Under intense illumination, such as at the focus of a laser-scanning microscope, these SHG nanocrystals convert two photons into one photon of half the wavelength; thus, when imaged by conventional two-photon microscopy, SHG nanoprobes appear to generate a signal with an inverse Stokes shift like a fluorescent dye, but with a narrower emission. Unlike commonly used fluorescent probes, SHG nanoprobes neither bleach nor blink, and the signal they generate does not saturate with increasing illumination intensity. The resulting contrast and detectability of SHG nanoprobes provide unique advantages for molecular imaging of living cells and tissues.},

The extra-embryonic yolk syncytial layer (YSL) tows the blastoderm vegetally during epiboly by means of its tight junction attachments to the enveloping layer (EVL). Claudins are the major transmembrane protein components of tight junctions. Here, we focus on the function of Claudin E (Cldne), which is expressed specifically in the EVL. Morpholino knock-down of cldne produced a highly penetrant epiboly delay. Our analysis suggested that the EVL margin, which is attached to the YSL, was under reduced tension in morphant embryos. We propose that local variation in the strength of EVL-YSL attachment in morphant embryos resulted in slow and uneven advancement of the EVL and blastoderm. Our work is the first to demonstrate that Claudins are important for zebrafish epiboly.},

abstract = {Cell migration is an essential process during many phases of development and adult life. Cells can either migrate as individuals or move in the context of tissues. Movement is controlled by internal and external signals, which activate complex signal transduction cascades resulting in highly dynamic and localised remodelling of the cytoskeleton, cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions. To understand these processes, it will be necessary to identify the critical structural cytoskeletal components, their spatio-temporal dynamics as well as those of the signalling pathways that control them. Imaging plays an increasingly important and powerful role in the analysis of these spatio-temporal dynamics. We will highlight a variety of imaging techniques and their use in the investigation of various aspects of cell motility, and illustrate their role in the characterisation of chemotaxis in Dictyostelium and cell movement during gastrulation in chick embryos in more detail.},

abstract = {Investigation of biochemical cues in isolation or in combinations in cell culture systems is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms that govern neural development and repair. The most widely used experimental paradigms that elicit axon guidance in vitro utilize as the source of the gradient a pulsatile pipette, transfected cells, or a loaded gel, producing time-varying gradients of poor reproducibility which are not well suited for studying slow-growing mammalian cells. Although microfluidic device design have allowed for generating stable, complex gradients of diffusible molecules, the flow-induced shear forces in a microchannel has made it impossible to maintain viable mammalian neuronal cultures for sufficiently long times. In this paper, we describe axonal responses of mouse cortical neurons in a "neuron-benign" gradient-generator device based on an open chamber that can establish highly stable gradients of diffusible molecules for at least 6 h with negligible shear stress, and also allows the neurons to thrive for at least 2 weeks. Except for the period when the gradient is on, the cells in the gradient are under the same conditions as the cells on the control surfaces, which ensure a consistent set of micro-environmental variables. The gradient stability and uniformity over the cell culture surface achieved by the device, together with our software platform for acquiring, post-processing and quantitatively analyzing the large number of images allowed us to extract valuable information even from small datasets. We report a directed response of primary mammalian neurons (from E14 embryonic mice cortex) to a diffusible gradient of netrin in vitro. We infer from our studies that a large majority (∼73%) of the neurons that extend axons during the gradient application grow towards the netrin source, and our data analysis also indicates that netrin acts as a growth factor for this same population of neurons.},

abstract = {Cells respond to a variety of secreted molecules by modifying their physiology, growth patterns, and behavior. Motile bacteria and eukaryotic cells can sense extracellular chemoattractants and chemorepellents and alter their movement. In this way fibroblasts and leukocytes can find their way to sites of injury and cancer cells can home in on sites that are releasing growth factors. Social amoebae such as Dictyostelium are chemotactic to cAMP which they secrete several hours after they have initiated development. These eukaryotic cells are known to be able to sense extremely shallow gradients but the processes underlying their exquisite sensitivity are still largely unknown. In this study we determine the responses of developed cells of Dictyostelium discoideum to stable linear gradients of cAMP of varying steepness generated in 2 μm deep gradient chambers of microfluidic devices. The gradients are generated by molecular diffusion between two 80 μm deep flow-through channels, one of which is perfused with a solution of cAMP and the other with buffer, serving as continuously replenished source and sink. These low ceiling gradient chambers constrained the cells in the vertical dimension, facilitating confocal imaging, such that subcellular localization of fluorescently tagged proteins could be followed for up to 30 min without noticeable phototoxicity. Chemotactic cells enter these low ceiling chambers by flattening and elongating and then move almost as rapidly as unconstrained cells. By following the localization of activated Ras (RasGTP) using a Ras Binding Domain fused to Green Fluorescent Protein (RBD-GFP), we observed the rapid appearance of membrane associated patches at the tips of pseudopods. These patches remained associated with pseudopods while they continued to extend but were rapidly disassembled when pseudopods stalled and the cell moved past them. Likewise, fluorescence associated with localized RasGTP rapidly disappeared when the gradient was turned off. Correlation of the size and persistence of RasGTP patches with extension of pseudopods may set the rules for understanding how the signal transduction mechanisms convert a weak external signal to a strong directional bias.},

abstract = {The directional migration of human neutrophils in classical chemotaxis assays is often described as a "biased random walk" implying significant randomness in speed and directionality. However, these experiments are inconsistent with in vivo observations, where neutrophils can navigate effectively through complex tissue microenvironments towards their targets. Here, we demonstrate a novel biomimetic assay for neutrophil chemotaxis using enclosed microfluidic channels. Remarkably, under these enclosed conditions, neutrophils recapitulate the highly robust and efficient navigation observed in vivo. In straight channels, neutrophils undergo sustained, unidirectional motion towards a chemoattractant source. In more complex maze-like geometries, neutrophils are able to select the most direct route over 90% of the time. Finally, at symmetric bifurcations, neutrophils split their leading edge into two sections and a "tug of war" ensues. The competition between the two new leading edges is ultimately resolved by stochastic, symmetry-breaking behavior. This behavior is suggestive of directional decision-making localized at the leading edge and a signaling role played by the cellular cytoskeleton.},

A thorough understanding of the chemotactic response of amoebae and neutrophils requires careful quantification of the cell shape changes observed during cell movement. The stochastic nature of this response calls for a statistical characterization of cellular morphology and this requires the processing of large data sets. For this reason, automatic image analysis algorithms are highly desirable and are becoming increasingly available. These usually include a combination of techniques from image segmentation, morphological transformations, as well as the incorporation of numerical algorithms and physical models. Here we review recent developments in the tracking and understanding of motile chemotaxing cells, with a particular emphasis on the description of pseudopodial activity in chemotactic Dictyostelium cells.},

abstract = {Chemotaxis assays are essential tools for the study of gradient sensing and directed cell migration, and have the potential to aid in the diagnosis and characterization of patients with immune disorders. Current methods are limited in their ability to meet the more demanding requirements for clinical applications. Because patient samples have a short lifespan and sometimes a limited volume (e.g. pediatrics), the operational requirements for an efficient chemotaxis assay are increased in the clinical setting. Here we describe a microscale assay platform for gradient generation that overcomes these limitations. Passive fluidic methods are leveraged to provide a reliable microfluidic gradient generation device, operable in only three pipetting steps. In addition, arrayed imaging and advanced cell tracking algorithms enabled a 50-fold increase in throughput over current methods. These methods were employed to aid in the diagnostic evaluation of an infant who presented with severe, recurrent bacterial infections. Analysis of the infant's neutrophils revealed impaired cell polarization and chemotaxis in a gradient of the chemoattractant fMLP. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with an inhibitory mutation in the Rho GTPase, Rac2. The approach also enabled a microenvironmental screen of human primary neutrophil chemotaxis on fibronectin, fibrinogen and laminin with results suggesting that fibronectin, although commonly used, may not be the most appropriate matrix protein for chemotaxis assays. Together, these findings demonstrate the use of arrayed micro-devices to aid in the diagnosis of a primary immunodeficiency disorder, and illustrate the capability for increased throughput microenvironmental studies and screening targeted to specific human diseases.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a computational tool that enables the simulation of mathematical models of cell migration and chemotaxis on an evolving cell membrane. Recent models require the numerical solution of systems of reaction-diffusion equations on the evolving cell membrane and then the solution state is used to drive the evolution of the cell edge. Previous work involved moving the cell edge using a level set method (LSM). However, the LSM is computationally very expensive, which severely limits the practical usefulness of the algorithm. To address this issue, we have employed the parameterised finite element method (PFEM) as an alternative method for evolving a cell boundary. We show that the PFEM is far more efficient and robust than the LSM. We therefore suggest that the PFEM potentially has an essential role to play in computational modelling efforts towards the understanding of many of the complex issues related to chemotaxis.},

In the past 10 years, engineering tools have been increasingly used to develop experimental platforms that capture important aspects of cellular microenvironments to allow quantitative and reproducible characterization of cellular response to gradients. This review discusses the emergence of microfluidics-based gradient generators and their applications in enhancing our understanding of fundamental biological processes such as chemotaxis and morphogenesis.

abstract = {Chemokine CXCL12 promotes CXCR4-dependent chemotaxis of cancer cells to characteristic organs and tissues, leading to metastatic disease. This study was designed to investigate how cells expressing CXCR7 regulate chemotaxis of a separate population of CXCR4 cells under physiologic conditions in which cells are exposed to gradients of CXCL12. We recapitulated a cancer-stroma microenvironment by patterning CXCR4-expressing cancer cells in microchannels at spatially defined positions relative to CXCL12-producing cells and CXCR7-expressing cells. CXCR7 scavenges and degrades CXCL12, which has been proposed to facilitate CXCR4-dependent chemotaxis through a source-sink model. Using the microchannel device, we demonstrated that chemotaxis of CXCR4 cells depended critically on the presence and location of CXCR7 cells (sink) relative to chemokine secreting cells (source). Furthermore, inhibiting CXCR4 on migrating cells or CXCR7 on sink cells blocked CXCR4-dependent chemotaxis toward CXCL12, showing that the device can identify new therapeutic agents that block migration by targeting chemoattractant scavenging receptors. Our system enables efficient chemotaxis under much shallower yet more physiological chemoattractant gradients by generating an in vitro microenvironment where combinations of cellular products may be secreted along with formation of a chemoattractant gradient. In addition to elucidating mechanisms of CXCL-12 mediated chemotaxis, this simple and robust method can be broadly useful for engineering multiple microenvironments to investigate intercellular communication.},

abstract = {Cells sense and interpret chemical gradients, and respond by localized responses that lead to directed migration. An open microfluidic device (OMD) was developed to provide quantitative information on both the gradient and morphological changes that occurred as cells crawled through various microfabricated channels. This device overcame problems that many current devices have been plagued with, such as complicated cell loading, media evaporation and channel blockage by air bubbles. We used a micropipette to set up stable gradients formed by passive diffusion and thus avoided confounding cellular responses produced by shear forces. Two versions of the OMD are reported here: one device that has channels with widths of 6, 8, 10 and 12 μm, while the other has two large 100 μm channels to minimize cellular interaction with lateral walls. These experiments compared the migration rates and qualitative behavior of Dictyostelium discoideum cells responding to measurable cAMP and folic acid gradients in small and large channels. We report on the influence that polarity has on a cell's ability to migrate when confined in a channel. Polarized cells that migrated to cAMP were significantly faster than the unpolarized cells that crawled toward folic acid. Unpolarized cells in wide channels often strayed off course, yet migrated faster than unpolarized cells in confined channels. Cells in channels farthest from the micropipette migrated through the channels at rates similar to cells in channels with higher concentrations, suggesting that cell speed was independent of mean concentration. Lastly, it was found that the polarized cells could easily change migration direction even when only the leading edge of the cell was exposed to a lateral gradient.},

abstract = {Microfluidics is revolutionizing the way we study the motile behavior of cells, by enabling observations at high spatial and temporal resolution in carefully controlled microenvironments. An important class of such behavior is bacterial chemotaxis, which plays a fundamental role in a broad range of processes, including disease pathogenesis, biofilm formation, bioremediation, and even carbon cycling in the ocean. In biophysical research, bacterial chemotaxis represents a powerful model system to understand how cells and organisms sense and respond to gradients. Using microfluidics to study chemotaxis of free-swimming bacteria presents experimental challenges that are distinct from those arising in chemotaxis studies of surface-adherent cells. Recently, these challenges have been met by the development of advanced microdevices, able to generate flow-free, steady gradients of arbitrary shape. Much attention to date has been focused on tool development. Yet, we are now at an exciting turning point where science begins to balance technology. Indeed, recent microfluidic studies provided new insights on both the mechanisms governing bacterial gradient sensing (e.g. tuning of response sensitivity, discrimination between conflicting gradients) and the large-scale consequences of chemotaxis (e.g. in the oceans). Here we outline the principles underlying recently proposed gradient generators for bacterial chemotaxis, illustrate the advantage of the microfluidic approach through selected examples, and identify a broader set of scientific questions that may now be addressed with this rapidly developing technology. The latest generation of microfluidic gradient generators, in particular, holds appeal for both biophysicists seeking to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of bacterial chemotaxis, and ecologists wishing to model chemotaxis in realistic environments. Time is ripe for a deeper integration between technology and biology in fully bringing to bear microfluidics on studies of this fascinating microbial behavior.},

abstract = {Collective migration is a basic mechanism of cell translocation during morphogenesis, wound repair and cancer invasion. Collective movement requires cells to retain cell-cell contacts, exhibit group polarization with defined front-rear asymmetry, and consequently move as one multicellular unit. Depending on the cell type, morphology of the group and the tissue context, distinct mechanisms control the leading edge dynamics and guidance. Leading edge migration may either result from adhesion to ECM and contractile pulling, or from forward pushing. The leading edge consists of either one or few dedicated tip cells or a multicellular leading row that generate adhesion and traction towards the tissue substrate. Alternatively, a multicellular bud consisting of many cells protrudes collectively by proliferation and growth thereby mechanically expanding and pushing towards the tissue stroma. Each type of collective guidance engages distinct spatiotemporal molecular control and feedback towards rearward cells and the adjacent tissue microenvironment; these include intrinsic polarity mechanisms regulated by the interplay between cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions; or the heterotypic integration of stromal cells that adopt leader cell functions. We here classify molecular and mechanical mechanisms of leading function in collective cell migration during morphogenesis and wound repair and discuss how these are recapitulated during collective invasion of cancer cells.},

Research into the critical processes involved in cell migration has so far mostly focused on cell adhesion and proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix. However, pharmacological interference with these processes only partially blocks cell motility in vivo. In this review we summarize the arising evidence that the mechanical properties of the cell body have a major role to play in cell motility--especially in a low-adhesion, amoeboid-like migration mode in three-dimensional tissue structures. We summarize the processes determining cell mechanics and discuss relevant measurement technologies including their applications in medical cell biology.},

Having two images to match, the main idea is to consider the objects boundaries in one image 
as semi-permeable membranes and to let the other image, considered as a deformable grid 
model, diffuse through these interfaces, by the action of effectors situated within the membranes. 
We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell's demons. We show that this concept 
relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step being optical 
flow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid 
matching algorithms, one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour 
points, and a last one operating on already segmented images. Finally, we present results with 
synthesized deformations and real medical images, with applications to heart motion tracking 
and three-dimensional inter-patients matching. },

abstract = {The observation that animal morphology tends to be conserved during the embryonic phylotypic period (a period of maximal similarity between the species within each animal phylum) led to the proposition that embryogenesis diverges more extensively early and late than in the middle, known as the hourglass model. This pattern of conservation is thought to reflect a major constraint on the evolution of animal body plans. Despite a wealth of morphological data confirming that there is often remarkable divergence in the early and late embryos of species from the same phylum, it is not yet known to what extent gene expression evolution, which has a central role in the elaboration of different animal forms, underpins the morphological hourglass pattern. Here we address this question using species-specific microarrays designed from six sequenced Drosophila species separated by up to 40 million years. We quantify divergence at different times during embryogenesis, and show that expression is maximally conserved during the arthropod phylotypic period. By fitting different evolutionary models to each gene, we show that at each time point more than 80% of genes fit best to models incorporating stabilizing selection, and that for genes whose evolutionarily optimal expression level is the same across all species, selective constraint is maximized during the phylotypic period. The genes that conform most to the hourglass pattern are involved in key developmental processes. These results indicate that natural selection acts to conserve patterns of gene expression during mid-embryogenesis, and provide a genome-wide insight into the molecular basis of the hourglass pattern of developmental evolution.},

abstract = {Evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo) as a discipline is concerned, among other things, with discovering and understanding the role of changes in developmental mechanisms in the evolutionary origin of aspects of the phenotype. In a very real sense, Evo-Devo opens the black box between genotype and phenotype, or more properly, phenotypes as multiple life history stages arise in many organisms from a single genotype. Changes in the timing or positioning of an aspect of development in a descendant relative to an ancestor (heterochrony and heterotopy) were two evolutionary developmental mechanisms identified by Ernst Haeckel in the 1870s. Many more have since been identified, in large part because of our enhanced understanding of development and because new mechanisms emerge as development proceeds: the transfer from maternal to zygotic genomic control; cell-to-cell interactions; cell differentiation and cell migration; embryonic inductions; functional interactions at the tissue and organ levels; growth. Within these emergent processes, gene networks and gene cascades (genetic modules) link the genotype with morphogenetic units (cellular modules, namely germ layers, embryonic fields or cellular condensations), while epigenetic processes such as embryonic inductions, tissue interactions and functional integration, link morphogenetic units to the phenotype. Evolutionary developmental mechanisms also include interactions between individuals of the same species, individuals of different species, and species and their biotic and/or abiotic environment. Such interactions link ecological communities. Importantly, there is little to distinguish the causality that underlies these interactions from that which underlies inductive interactions within embryos.},

Mainly in the past fifteen years, however, these previously dispersed integrating programmes have been themselves synthesized and so reinvigorated. Two of these more recent synthesizing endeavours are evolutionary developmental biology (EDB, or "evo-devo") and developmental systems theory (DST). While the former is a bourgeoning and scientifically well-respected biological discipline, the same cannot be said of DST, which is virtually unknown among biologists. In this review, we provide overviews of DST and EDB, summarize their key tenets, examine how they relate to one another and to the study of epigenetics, and survey the impact that DST and EDB have had (and in future should have) on biological theory and practice.},

Although its real-world relevance was long debated, a number of compelling examples have gradually alleviated much of the skepticism surrounding the model. The RD model can generate a wide variety of spatial patterns, and mathematical studies have revealed the kinds of interactions required for each, giving this model the potential for application as an experimental working hypothesis in a wide variety of morphological phenomena. In this review, we describe the essence of this theory for experimental biologists unfamiliar with the model, using examples from experimental studies in which the RD model is effectively incorporated.},

In the mesenchymal model, cells exert tractions which deform the extracellular matrix within which they move. This in turn affects their motion. The model field equations are formulated and analysed, and applied to two widely studied phenomena: skin-organ primordia for feather and scale patterns, and the development of cartilage patterns in limb bone formation. The model for epithelial pattern formation consists of viscoelastic field equations with a calcium-controlled contraction trigger. Preliminary analysis is presented which demonstrates the existence of travelling wave solutions.},

abstract = {A mathematical model of the forces and deformations of the tissues involved in branching morphogenesis is developed and solved. The epithelium and mesenchyme are modeled as Stokes fluids separated by an interface. Each fluid is assumed to have constant viscosity. An initially 3-lobed rudiment is deformed by three inwardly directed point forces. Relationships between the physical parameters of the model (tissue viscosity, clefting force, surface tension) and the time course and morphology are explored. We find that the surface tension, clefting force, and viscosity ratio of the two tissues have significant effects on the branching. We conclude that epithelial branching in soft gels is fundamentally different from epithelial branching in mesenchyme, because of the different mechanics. We propose that a complete understanding of branching morphogenesis requires measurements of the mechanical aspects.},

During embryonic development, normal morphogenesis depends on a series of concerted cell movements; but the roles of cell adhesion signaling during these movements are poorly understood. The transparent zebrafish embryo provides an excellent system to study cell migration during development. Here, we have identified zebrafish git2a and git2b, two new members of the GIT family of genes that encode ArfGAP proteins associated with cell adhesions. Loss-of-function studies revealed an essential role for Git2a in zebrafish cell movements during gastrulation. Time-lapse microscopy analysis demonstrated that antisense depletion of Git2a greatly reduced or arrested cell migration towards the vegetal pole of the embryo. These defects were rescued by expression of chicken GIT2, indicating a specific and conserved role for Git2 in controlling embryonic cell movements. Git2a knockdown embryos showed defects in cell morphology that were associated with reduced cell contractility. We show that Git2a is required for phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), which regulates myosin II-mediated cell contractility. Consistent with this, embryos treated with Blebbistatin-a small molecule inhibitor for myosin II activity-exhibited cell movement defects similar to git2a knockdown embryos. These observations provide in vivo evidence of a physiologic role for Git2a in regulating cell morphogenesis and directed cell migration via myosin II activation during zebrafish embryonic development.},

abstract = {We have characterized mutations in the early arrest gene, harpy (hrp), and show that they introduce premature stops in the coding region of early mitotic inhibitor1 (Rca1/emi1). In harpy mutants, cells stop dividing during early gastrulation. Lineage analysis confirms that there is little change in cell number after approximately cycle-14. Gross patterning occurs relatively normally, and many organ primordia are produced on time but with smaller numbers of cells. Despite the lack of cell division, some organ systems continue to increase in cell number, suggesting recruitment from surrounding areas. Analysis of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation shows that endoreduplication continues in many cells well past the first day of development, but cells cease endoreduplication once they begin to differentiate and express cell-type markers. Despite relatively normal gross patterning, harpy mutants show several defects in morphogenesis, cell migration and differentiation resulting directly or indirectly from the arrest of cell division.},

abstract = {The yolk extension (YE) appears to be a novel developmental module that has been inserted into the phylotypic period of teleostean development, specifically in the order Cypriniformes. The zebrafish YE informs the study of morphogenetic movements reshaping ventral tissues because (1) this trait is easily visible, so disruptions are easy to score; (2) its ontogenesis occurs quickly; and (3) the yolk cell isolates the tissues elongating the ventrum from the rest of the embryo, serving as a three-dimensional in vivo "tissue culture." We determined that three histological compartments comprise the structural components of the YE: (1) the internal yolk cell; (2) the mesendodermal mantle external to the yolk cell; and (3) the external embryonic integument, consisting of an embryonic epidermis plus enveloping layer cells. These structural components interact with one another in a hierarchical manner, resulting in the morphogenesis of the elongated and tubular embryonic zebrafish ventrum as the cylindrical YE forms. Time-lapse videomicroscopy and experimental manipulation show that the yolk mass is a cohesive, viscoelastic foam, which resists compression. Moreover, as the mesodermal mantle participates in tubulation of the posterior trunk, Kupffer's Vesicle, the organ of laterality in teleosts, separates from the posterior pole of the yolk syncytial layer. Additionally, the embryonic integument becomes contractile over the posterior yolk cell, constricting the yolk mass to form the YE. These findings constitute an initial assessment of the morphogenetic mechanics underlying formation of the YE developmental module in zebrafish.},

abstract = {The morphogenesis of vertebrate body parts remains an open question. It is not clear whether the existence of different structures, such as a head, can be addressed by fundamental laws of tissue movement and deformation, or whether they are only a sequence of stop-and-go genetic instructions. I have filmed by time-lapse microscopy the formation of the presumptive head territory in chicken embryos. I show that the early lateral evagination of the eye cups and of the mesencephalic plate is a consequence of a sudden change in boundary conditions of the initial cell flow occurring in these embryos. Due to tissue flow, and collision of the two halves of the embryo, the tissue sheet movement is first dipolar, and next quadrupolar. In vivo air puff tonometry reveals a simple visco-elastic behaviour of the living material. The jump from a dipolar to a quadrupolar flow changes the topology of the early morphogenetic field which is observed towards a complex vortex winding with a trail (the eye cups and brain folds). The hydrodynamical model accounts for the discontinuity of the vector field at the moment of collision of the left and right halves of the embryo, at a quantitative level. This suggests a possible mechanism for the morphogenesis of the head of amniotes, as compared to cephalochordates and anamniotes.},

In zebrafish, regional differences of C{\&}E movements have been observed; however, the underlying cell behaviors are poorly understood. Using time-lapse analyses and computational modeling, we demonstrate that C{\&}E of the medial presomitic mesoderm is achieved by cooperation of planar and radial cell intercalations. Radial intercalations preferentially separate anterior and posterior neighbors to promote extension. In knypek;trilobite noncanonical Wnt mutants, the frequencies of cell intercalations are altered and the anteroposterior bias of radial intercalations is lost. This provides evidence for noncanonical Wnt signaling polarizing cell movements between different mesodermal cell layers. We further show using fluorescent fusion proteins that during dorsal mesoderm C{\&}E, the noncanonical Wnt component Prickle localizes at the anterior cell edge, whereas Dishevelled is enriched posteriorly. Asymmetrical localization of Prickle and Dishevelled to the opposite cell edges in zebrafish gastrula parallels their distribution in fly, and suggests that noncanonical Wnt signaling defines distinct anterior and posterior cell properties to bias cell intercalations.},

abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) function as genetic rheostats to control gene output. Based on their role as modulators, it has been postulated that miRNAs canalize development and provide genetic robustness. Here, we uncover a previously unidentified regulatory layer of chemokine signaling by miRNAs that confers genetic robustness on primordial germ cell (PGC) migration. In zebrafish, PGCs are guided to the gonad by the ligand Sdf1a, which is regulated by the sequestration receptor Cxcr7b. We find that miR-430 regulates sdf1a and cxcr7 mRNAs. Using target protectors, we demonstrate that miR-430-mediated regulation of endogenous sdf1a (also known as cxcl12a) and cxcr7b (i) facilitates dynamic expression of sdf1a by clearing its mRNA from previous expression domains, (ii) modulates the levels of the decoy receptor Cxcr7b to avoid excessive depletion of Sdf1a and (iii) buffers against variation in gene dosage of chemokine signaling components to ensure accurate PGC migration. Our results indicate that losing miRNA-mediated regulation can expose otherwise buffered genetic lesions leading to developmental defects.},

abstract = {Vertebrate mesoderm and endoderm formation requires signaling by Nodal-related ligands from the TGFβ superfamily. The factors that initiate Nodal-related gene transcription are unknown in most species and the relative contributions of Nodal-related ligands from embryonic, extraembryonic and maternal sources remain uncertain. In zebrafish, signals from the yolk syncytial layer (YSL), an extraembryonic domain, are required for mesoderm and endoderm induction, and YSL expression of nodal-related 1 (ndr1) and ndr2 accounts for a portion of this activity. A variable requirement of maternally derived Ndr1 for dorsal and anterior axis formation has also been documented. Here we show that Mxtx2 directly activates expression of ndr2 via binding to its first intron and is required for ndr2 expression in the YSL. Mxtx2 is also required for the Nodal signaling-independent expression component of the no tail a (ntla) gene, which is required for posterior (tail) mesoderm formation. Therefore, Mxtx2 defines a new pathway upstream of Nodal signaling and posterior mesoderm formation. We further show that the co-disruption of extraembryonic Ndr2, extraembryonic Ndr1 and maternal Ndr1 eliminates endoderm and anterior (head and trunk) mesoderm, recapitulating the loss of Nodal signaling phenotype. Therefore, non-embryonic sources of Nodal-related ligands account for the complete spectrum of early Nodal signaling requirements. In summary, the induction of mesoderm and endoderm depends upon the combined actions of Mxtx2 and Nodal-related ligands from non-embryonic sources.},

abstract = {This paper presents a first forced-based dynamics computer model of a cell cluster moving collectively in a 3D environment mimicking the extracellular matrix. In general, collective cell migration is a relevant part of the mechanisms for tissue repair, morphogenesis, and cancer invasion. Particularly in cancer, invasion occurs through multicellular 3D strands as well as collective cell clusters. Because cancer is a slow process, these clusters have not been carefully observed. However, the prevalence of this mechanism of cell locomotion makes it a target for study. Due to the different molecular mechanisms involved in this movement and the complex relations among them, a computer model would be of great use. The model presented here takes into account ligand concentration, matrix metalloproteinase activity, and cluster geometry based on experimental findings and experimentally validated single cell computer models; thus incorporating implicitly different underlying molecular properties. The velocity profiles of the cell clusters were recorded and analyzed. In particular seven different profiles are observed based on different participation of ligands, proteinases, and mechanical forces involved. The model is successful in showing potential effects of altering single variables in a system of cells in motion. Special emphasis is made on future directions for improvement and the variables to be potentially modulated to simulate particular physiological conditions.},

abstract = {The developing zebrafish embryo has been the subject of many studies of regional patterning, stereotypical cell movements and changes in cell shape. To better study the morphological features of cells during gastrulation, we generated mosaic embryos expressing membrane attached Dendra2 to highlight cellular boundaries. We find that intercellular bridges join a significant fraction of epiblast cells in the zebrafish embryo, reaching several cell diameters in length and spanning across different regions of the developing embryos. These intercellular bridges are distinct from the cellular protrusions previously reported as extending from hypoblast cells (1-2 cellular diameters in length) or epiblast cells (which were shorter). Most of the intercellular bridges were formed at pre-gastrula stages by the daughters of a dividing cell maintaining a membrane tether as they move apart after mitosis. These intercellular bridges persist during gastrulation and can mediate the transfer of proteins between distant cells. These findings reveal a surprising feature of the cellular landscape in zebrafish embryos and open new possibilities for cell-cell communication during gastrulation, with implications for modeling, cellular mechanics, and morphogenetic signaling.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties of cells change as they proceed through the cell cycle, primarily owing to regulation of actin and myosin II. Most models for cell mechanics focus on actomyosin in the cortex and ignore possible roles in bulk cytoplasm. We explored cell cycle regulation of bulk cytoplasmic actomyosin in Xenopus egg extracts, which is almost undiluted cytoplasm from unfertilized eggs. We observed dramatic gelation-contraction of actomyosin in mitotic (M phase) extract where Cdk1 activity is high, but not in interphase (I-phase) extract. In spread droplets, M-phase extract exhibited regular, periodic pulses of gelation-contraction a few minutes apart that continued for many minutes. Comparing actin nucleation, disassembly and myosin II activity between M-phase and I-phase extracts, we conclude that regulation of nucleation is likely to be the most important for cell cycle regulation. We then imaged F-actin in early zebrafish blastomeres using a GFP-Utrophin probe. Polymerization in bulk cytoplasm around vesicles increased dramatically during mitosis, consistent with enhanced nucleation. We conclude that F-actin polymerization in bulk cytoplasm is cell cycle regulated in early vertebrate embryos and discuss possible biological functions of this regulation.},

abstract = {Cells perceive their microenvironment not only through soluble signals but also through physical and mechanical cues, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness or confined adhesiveness. By mechanotransduction systems, cells translate these stimuli into biochemical signals controlling multiple aspects of cell behaviour, including growth, differentiation and cancer malignant progression, but how rigidity mechanosensing is ultimately linked to activity of nuclear transcription factors remains poorly understood. Here we report the identification of the Yorkie-homologues YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif, also known as WWTR1) as nuclear relays of mechanical signals exerted by ECM rigidity and cell shape. This regulation requires Rho GTPase activity and tension of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, but is independent of the Hippo/LATS cascade. Crucially, YAP/TAZ are functionally required for differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells induced by ECM stiffness and for survival of endothelial cells regulated by cell geometry; conversely, expression of activated YAP overrules physical constraints in dictating cell behaviour. These findings identify YAP/TAZ as sensors and mediators of mechanical cues instructed by the cellular microenvironment.},

This clock comprises a multicellular genetic network of synchronized oscillators, coupled by intercellular Delta-Notch signaling. How this synchrony is established and how its loss determines the position of segmentation defects in Delta and Notch mutants are unknown. We analyzed the clock's synchrony dynamics by varying strength and timing of Notch coupling in zebra-fish embryos with techniques for quantitative perturbation of gene function. We developed a physical theory based on coupled phase oscillators explaining the observed onset and rescue of segmentation defects, the clock's robustness against developmental noise, and a critical point beyond which synchrony decays. We conclude that synchrony among these genetic oscillators can be established by simultaneous initiation and self-organization and that the segmentation defect position is determined by the difference between coupling strength and noise.},

abstract = {The generation of metameric body plans is a key process in development. In Drosophila segmentation, periodicity is established rapidly through the complex transcriptional regulation of the pair-rule genes. The 'primary' pair-rule genes generate their 7-stripe expression through stripe-specific cis-regulatory elements controlled by the preceding non-periodic maternal and gap gene patterns, whereas 'secondary' pair-rule genes are thought to rely on 7-stripe elements that read off the already periodic primary pair-rule patterns. Using a combination of computational and experimental approaches, we have conducted a comprehensive systems-level examination of the regulatory architecture underlying pair-rule stripe formation. We find that runt (run), fushi tarazu (ftz) and odd skipped (odd) establish most of their pattern through stripe-specific elements, arguing for a reclassification of ftz and odd as primary pair-rule genes. In the case of run, we observe long-range cis-regulation across multiple intervening genes. The 7-stripe elements of run, ftz and odd are active concurrently with the stripe-specific elements, indicating that maternal/gap-mediated control and pair-rule gene cross-regulation are closely integrated. Stripe-specific elements fall into three distinct classes based on their principal repressive gap factor input; stripe positions along the gap gradients correlate with the strength of predicted input. The prevalence of cis-elements that generate two stripes and their genomic organization suggest that single-stripe elements arose by splitting and subfunctionalization of ancestral dual-stripe elements. Overall, our study provides a greatly improved understanding of how periodic patterns are established in the Drosophila embryo.},

We use our antibodies to show that these Delta proteins can bind to one another homo- and heterophilically, and to study the localisation of DeltaC and DeltaD in the zebrafish nervous system and presomitic mesoderm (PSM). Our findings in the nervous system largely confirm expectations from previous studies, but in the PSM we see an unexpected pattern in which the localisation of DeltaD varies according to the level of expression of DeltaC: in the anterior PSM, where DeltaC is plentiful, the two proteins are colocalised in intracellular puncta, but in the posterior PSM, where DeltaC is at a lower level, DeltaD is seen mainly on the cell surface. Forced overexpression of DeltaC reduces the amount of DeltaD on the cell surface in the posterior PSM; conversely, loss-of-function mutation of DeltaC increases the amount of DeltaD on the cell surface in the anterior PSM. These findings suggest an explanation for a long-standing puzzle regarding the functions of the two Delta proteins in the somite segmentation clock--an explanation that is based on the proposition that they associate heterophilically to activate Notch.},

abstract = {The forces that drive sea urchin primary invagination remain mysterious. To solve this mystery we have developed a set of finite element simulations that test five hypothesized mechanisms. Our models show that each of these mechanisms can generate an invagination; however, the mechanical properties of an epithelial sheet required for proper invagination are different for each mechanism. For example, we find that the gel swelling hypothesis of Lane et al. (Lane, M. C., Koehl, M. A. R., Wilt, F. and Keller, R. (1993) Development 117, 1049-1060) requires the embryo to possess a mechanically stiff apical extracellular matrix and highly deformable cells, whereas a hypothesis based on apical constriction of the epithelial cells requires a more compliant extracellular matrix. For each mechanism, we have mapped out a range of embryo designs that work. Additionally, the simulations predict specific cell shape changes accompanying each mechanism. This allows us to design experiments that can distinguish between different mechanisms, all of which can, in principle, drive primary invagination.},

abstract = {The active migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) from their site of specification towards their target is a valuable model for investigating directed cell migration within the complex environment of the developing embryo. In several vertebrates, PGC migration is guided by Cxcl12, a member of the chemokine superfamily. Interestingly, two distinct Cxcl12 paralogs are expressed in zebrafish embryos and contribute to the chemotattractive landscape. Although this offers versatility in the use of chemokine signals, it also requires a mechanism through which migrating cells prioritize the relevant cues that they encounter. Here, we show that PGCs respond preferentially to one of the paralogs and define the molecular basis for this biased behavior. We find that a single amino acid exchange switches the relative affinity of the Cxcl12 ligands for one of the duplicated Cxcr4 receptors, thereby determining the functional specialization of each chemokine that elicits a distinct function in a distinct process. This scenario represents an example of protein subfunctionalization--the specialization of two gene copies to perform complementary functions following gene duplication--which in this case is based on receptor-ligand interaction. Such specialization increases the complexity and flexibility of chemokine signaling in controlling concurrent developmental processes.},

abstract = {Because of the resemblance of many epithelial tissues to densely packed soap bubbles, it has been suggested that surface minimization, which drives soap bubble packing, could be governing cell packing as well. We test this by modeling the shape of the cells in a Drosophila retina ommatidium. We use the observed configurations and shapes in wild-type flies, as well as in flies with different numbers of cells per ommatidia, and mutants with cells where E- or N-cadherin is either deleted or misexpressed. We find that surface minimization is insufficient to model the experimentally observed shapes and packing of the cells based on their cadherin expression. We then consider a model in which adhesion leads to a surface increase, balanced by cell cortex contraction. Using the experimentally observed distributions of E- and N-cadherin, we simulate the packing and cell shapes in the wild-type eye. Furthermore, by changing only the corresponding parameters, this model can describe the mutants with different numbers of cells or changes in cadherin expression.},

abstract = {Morphology evolves often through changes in developmental genes, but the causal mutations, and their effects, remain largely unknown. The evolution of naked cuticle on larvae of Drosophila sechellia resulted from changes in five transcriptional enhancers of shavenbaby (svb), a transcript of the ovo locus that encodes a transcription factor that governs morphogenesis of microtrichiae, hereafter called 'trichomes'. Here we show that the function of one of these enhancers evolved through multiple single-nucleotide substitutions that altered both the timing and level of svb expression. The consequences of these nucleotide substitutions on larval morphology were quantified with a novel functional assay. We found that each substitution had a relatively small phenotypic effect, and that many nucleotide changes account for this large morphological difference. In addition, we observed that the substitutions had non-additive effects. These data provide unprecedented resolution of the phenotypic effects of substitutions and show how individual nucleotide changes in a transcriptional enhancer have caused morphological evolution.},

abstract = {Canonical Wnt signalling has been implicated in mouse and human embryonic stem cell (ESC) maintenance; however, its requirement is controversial. β-catenin is the key component in this highly conserved Wnt pathway, acting as a transcriptional transactivator. However, β-catenin has additional roles at the plasma membrane regulating cell-cell adhesion, complicating the analyses of cells/tissues lacking β-catenin. We report here the generation of a Ctnnb1 (β-catenin)-deficient mouse ESC (mESC) line and show that self-renewal is maintained in the absence of β-catenin. Cell adhesion is partially rescued by plakoglobin upregulation, but fails to be maintained during differentiation. When differentiated as aggregates, wild-type mESCs form descendants of all three germ layers, whereas mesendodermal germ layer formation and neuronal differentiation are defective in Ctnnb1-deficient mESCs. A Tcf/Lef-signalling-defective β-catenin variant, which re-establishes cadherin-mediated cell adhesion, rescues definitive endoderm and neuroepithelial formation, indicating that the β-catenin cell-adhesion function is more important than its signalling function for these processes.},

abstract = {In the initial phase of development of fish embryos, a prominent and critical event is the midblastula transition (MBT). Before MBT cell cycle is rapid, highly synchronous and zygotic gene transcription is turned off. Only during MBT the cell cycle desynchronizes and transcription is activated. Multiple mechanisms, primarily the nucleocytoplasmic ratio, are supposed to control MBT activation. Unexpectedly, we find in the small teleost fish medaka (Oryzias latipes) that at very early stages, well before midblastula, cell division becomes asynchronous and cell volumes diverge. Furthermore, zygotic transcription is extensively activated already after the 64-cell stage. Thus, at least in medaka, the transition from maternal to zygotic transcription is uncoupled from the midblastula stage and not solely controlled by the nucleocytoplasmic ratio.},

abstract = {Asymmetric cell divisions are essential for the development of multicellular organisms. To proceed, they require an initially symmetric cell to polarize. In Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes, anteroposterior polarization is facilitated by a large-scale flow of the actomyosin cortex, which directs the asymmetry of the first mitotic division. Cortical flows appear in many contexts of development, but their underlying forces and physical principles remain poorly understood. How actomyosin contractility and cortical tension interact to generate large-scale flow is unclear. Here we report on the subcellular distribution of cortical tension in the polarizing C. elegans zygote, which we determined using position- and direction-sensitive laser ablation. We demonstrate that cortical flow is associated with anisotropies in cortical tension and is not driven by gradients in cortical tension, which contradicts previous proposals. These experiments, in conjunction with a theoretical description of active cortical mechanics, identify two prerequisites for large-scale cortical flow: a gradient in actomyosin contractility to drive flow and a sufficiently large viscosity of the cortex to allow flow to be long-ranged. We thus reveal the physical requirements of large-scale intracellular cortical flow that ensure the efficient polarization of the C. elegans zygote.},

abstract = {Morphogenesis takes place against a background of organism-to-organism and environmental variation. Therefore, fundamental questions in the study of morphogenesis include: How are the mechanical processes of tissue movement and deformation affected by that variability, and in turn, how do the mechanic of the system modulate phenotypic variation? We highlight a few key factors, including environmental temperature, embryo size and environmental chemistry that might perturb the mechanics of morphogenesis in natural populations. Then we discuss several ways in which mechanics-including feedback from mechanical cues-might influence intra-specific variation in morphogenesis. To understand morphogenesis it will be necessary to consider whole-organism, environment and evolutionary scales because these larger scales present the challenges that developmental mechanisms have evolved to cope with. Studying the variation organisms express and the variation organisms experience will aid in deciphering the causes of birth defects.},

abstract = {Formation of the mammalian primitive streak appears to rely on cell proliferation to a minor extent only, but compensating cell movements have not yet been directly observed. This study analyses individual cell migration and proliferation simultaneously, using multiphoton and differential interference contrast time-lapse microscopy of late pregastrulation rabbit blastocysts. Epiblast cells in the posterior gastrula extension area accumulated medially and displayed complex planar movements including U-turns and a novel type of processional cell movement. In the same area metaphase plates tended to be aligned parallel to the anterior-posterior axis, and statistical analysis showed that rotations of metaphase plates causing preferred orientation were near-complete 8 min before anaphase onset; in some cases, rotations were strikingly rapid, achieving up to 45$\,^{\circ}$ per min. The mammalian primitive streak appears to be formed initially with its typically minimal anteroposterior elongation by a combination of oriented cell divisions with dedicated planar cell movements.

abstract = {Extracellular signaling molecules have crucial roles in development and homeostasis, and their incorrect deployment can lead to developmental defects and disease states. Signaling molecules are released from sending cells, travel to target cells, and act over length scales of several orders of magnitude, from morphogen-mediated patterning of small developmental fields to hormonal signaling throughout the organism. We discuss how signals are modified and assembled for transport, which routes they take to reach their targets, and how their range is affected by mobility and stability.},

This book provides a comprehensive and systematic development of the basic concepts, principles, and procedures for verification and validation of models and simulations. The emphasis is placed on models that are described by partial differential and integral equations and the simulations that result from their numerical solution. The methods described can be applied to a wide range of technical fields, from the physical sciences, engineering and technology and industry, through to environmental regulations and safety, product and plant safety, financial investing, and governmental regulations. This book will be genuinely welcomed by researchers, practitioners, and decision makers in a broad range of fields, who seek to improve the credibility and reliability of simulation results. It will also be appropriate either for university courses or for independent study.},

abstract = {Nuclear shape is different in stem cells and differentiated cells and reflects important changes in the mechanics of the nuclear envelope (NE). The current framework emphasizes the key role of the nuclear lamina in nuclear mechanics and its alterations in disease. Whether active stress controls nuclear deformations and how this stress interplays with properties of the NE to control NE dynamics is unclear. We address this in the early Drosophila embryo, in which profound changes in NE shape parallel the transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. We show that microtubule (MT) polymerization events produce the elementary forces necessary for NE dynamics. Moreover, large-scale NE deformations associated with groove formation require concentration of MT polymerization in bundles organized by Dynein. However, MT bundles cannot produce grooves when the farnesylated inner nuclear membrane protein Kugelkern (Kuk) is absent. Although it increases stiffness of the NE, Kuk also stabilizes NE deformations emerging from the collective effect of MT polymerization forces concentrated in bundles. Finally, we report that MT-induced NE deformations control the dynamics of chromatin and its organization at steady state. Thus, the NE is a dynamic organelle, fluctuations of which increase chromatin dynamics. We propose that such mechanical regulation of chromatin dynamics by MTs might be important for gene regulation.},

abstract = {Vertebrate embryos display a predominant head-to-tail body axis whose formation is associated with the progressive development of post-cranial structures from a pool of caudal undifferentiated cells. This involves the maintenance of active FGF signaling in this caudal region as a consequence of the restricted production of the secreted factor FGF8. FGF8 is transcribed specifically in the caudal precursor region and is down-regulated as cells differentiate and the embryo extends caudally. We are interested in understanding the progressive down-regulation of FGF8 and its coordination with the caudal movement of cells which is also known to be FGF-signaling dependent. Our study is performed using mathematical modeling and computer simulations. We use an individual-based hybrid model as well as a caricature continuous model for the simulation of experimental observations (ours and those known from the literature) in order to examine possible mechanisms that drive differentiation and cell movement during the axis elongation. Using these models we have identified a possible gene regulatory network involving self-repression of a caudal morphogen coupled to directional domain movement that may account for progressive down-regulation of FGF8 and conservation of the FGF8 domain of expression. Furthermore, we have shown that chemotaxis driven by molecules, such as FGF8 secreted in the stem zone, could underlie the migration of the caudal precursor zone and, therefore, embryonic axis extension. These mechanisms may also be at play in other developmental processes displaying a similar mode of axis extension coupled to cell differentiation.},

abstract = {The study of networks pervades all of science, from neurobiology to statistical physics. The most basic issues are structural: how does one characterize the wiring diagram of a food web or the Internet or the metabolic network of the bacterium Escherichia coli? Are there any unifying principles underlying their topology? From the perspective of nonlinear dynamics, we would also like to understand how an enormous network of interacting dynamical systems-be they neurons, power stations or lasers-will behave collectively, given their individual dynamics and coupling architecture. Researchers are only now beginning to unravel the structure and dynamics of complex networks.},

abstract = {Self-propelled particles are used to simulate cell aggregates in a model considering homogeneous adhesion forces between cells and using only motility differences as segregation drivers. The tendency of cells to follow their neighbors is also included in the formulation. Three model variants are explored, and the conditions on which motility differences may produce segregation are mapped in parameter diagrams. The evolution of the order parameter measuring cell segregation is similar to those found by models based on differential adhesion. It is also found that, considering only velocity differences, the faster cells envelope the slower ones, which is opposite to the ordering observed in early experiments by Jones and co-workers [Jones, Evans, and Lee, Exp. Cell. Res. 180, 287 (1989)].},

abstract = {The currently accepted interpretation of the clock and wavefront model of somitogenesis is that a posteriorly moving molecular gradient sequentially slows the rate of clock oscillations, resulting in a spatial readout of temporal oscillations. However, while molecular components of the clocks and wavefronts have now been identified in the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM), there is not yet conclusive evidence demonstrating that the observed molecular wavefronts act to slow clock oscillations. Here we present an alternative formulation of the clock and wavefront model in which oscillator coupling, already known to play a key role in oscillator synchronisation, plays a fundamentally important role in the slowing of oscillations along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Our model has three parameters which can be determined, in any given species, by the measurement of three quantities: the clock period in the posterior PSM, somite length and the length of the PSM. A travelling wavefront, which slows oscillations along the AP axis, is an emergent feature of the model. Using the model we predict: (a) the distance between moving stripes of gene expression; (b) the number of moving stripes of gene expression and (c) the oscillator period profile along the AP axis. Predictions regarding the stripe data are verified using existing zebrafish data. We simulate a range of experimental perturbations and demonstrate how the model can be used to unambiguously define a reference frame along the AP axis. Comparing data from zebrafish, chick, mouse and snake, we demonstrate that: (a) variation in patterning profiles is accounted for by a single nondimensional parameter; the ratio of coupling strengths; and (b) the period profile along the AP axis is conserved across species. Thus the model is consistent with the idea that, although the genes involved in pattern propagation in the PSM vary, there is a conserved patterning mechanism across species.},

abstract = {The segregation of cells into germ layers is one of the earliest events in the establishment of cell fate in the embryo. In the zebrafish, endoderm and mesoderm are derived from cells that involute into an internal layer, the hypoblast, whereas ectoderm is derived from cells that remain in the outer layer, the epiblast. In this study, we examine the origin of the zebrafish endoderm and its separation from the mesoderm. By labeling individual cells located at the margin of the blastula, we demonstrate that all structures that are endodermal in origin are derived predominantly from the more dorsal and lateral cells of the blastoderm margin. Frequently marginal cells give rise to both endodermal and mesodermal derivatives, demonstrating that these two lineages have not yet separated. Cells located farther than 4 cell diameters from the margin give rise exclusively to mesoderm, and not to endoderm. Following involution, we see a variety of cellular changes indicating the differentiation of the two germ layers. Endodermal cells gradually flatten and extend filopodial processes forming a noncontiguous inner layer of cells against the yolk. At this time, they also begin to express Forkhead-domain 2 protein. Mesodermal cells form a coherent layer of round cells separating the endoderm and ectoderm. In cyclops-mutant embryos that have reduced mesodermal anlage, we demonstrate that by late gastrulation not only mesodermal but also endodermal cells are fewer in number. This suggests that a common pathway initially specifies germ layers together before a progressive sequence of determinative events segregate endoderm and mesoderm into morphologically distinct germ layers.},

Over the past decade, studies in vertebrate model organisms, including frog, fish, chick, and mouse, have greatly enhanced our understanding of the molecular basis of endoderm organ development. We review this progress with a focus on early stages of endoderm organogenesis including endoderm formation, gut tube morphogenesis and patterning, and organ specification. Lastly, we discuss how developmental mechanisms that regulate endoderm organogenesis are used to direct differentiation of embryonic stem cells into specific adult cell types, which function to alleviate disease symptoms in animal models.},

abstract = {For nearly 150 years, it has been recognized that cell shape strongly influences the orientation of the mitotic cleavage plane (e.g., Hofmeister, 1863). However, we still understand little about the complex interplay between cell shape and cleavage-plane orientation in epithelia, where polygonal cell geometries emerge from multiple factors, including cell packing, cell growth, and cell division itself. Here, using mechanical simulations, we show that the polygonal shapes of individual cells can systematically bias the long-axis orientations of their adjacent mitotic neighbors. Strikingly, analyses of both animal epithelia and plant epidermis confirm a robust and nearly identical correlation between local cell topology and cleavage-plane orientation in vivo. Using simple mathematics, we show that this effect derives from fundamental packing constraints. Our results suggest that local epithelial topology is a key determinant of cleavage-plane orientation, and that cleavage-plane bias may be a widespread property of polygonal cell sheets in plants and animals.},

abstract = {The process of gastrulation is highly conserved across vertebrates on both the genetic and morphological levels, despite great variety in embryonic shape and speed of development. This mechanism spatially separates the germ layers and establishes the organizational foundation for future development. Mesodermal identity is specified in a superficial layer of cells, the epiblast, where cells maintain an epithelioid morphology. These cells involute to join the deeper hypoblast layer where they adopt a migratory, mesenchymal morphology. Expression of a cascade of related transcription factors orchestrates the parallel genetic transition from primitive to mature mesoderm. Although the early and late stages of this process are increasingly well understood, the transition between them has remained largely mysterious. We present here the first high resolution in vivo observations of the blebby transitional morphology of involuting mesodermal cells in a vertebrate embryo. We further demonstrate that the zebrafish spadetail mutation creates a reversible block in the maturation program, stalling cells in the transition state. This mutation creates an ideal system for dissecting the specific properties of cells undergoing the morphological transition of maturing mesoderm, as we demonstrate with a direct measurement of cell-cell adhesion.},

abstract = {Collective cell migration is a mode of movement crucial for morphogenesis and cancer metastasis. However, little is known about how migratory cells coordinate collectively. Here we show that mutual cell-cell attraction (named here coattraction) is required to maintain cohesive clusters of migrating mesenchymal cells. Coattraction can counterbalance the natural tendency of cells to disperse via mechanisms such as contact inhibition and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Neural crest cells are coattracted via the complement fragment C3a and its receptor C3aR, revealing an unexpected role of complement proteins in early vertebrate development. Loss of coattraction disrupts collective and coordinated movements of these cells. We propose that coattraction and contact inhibition act in concert to allow cell collectives to self-organize and respond efficiently to external signals, such as chemoattractants and repellents.},

abstract = {Morphogenesis takes place against a background of organism-to-organism and environmental variation. Therefore, fundamental questions in the study of morphogenesis include: How are the mechanical processes of tissue movement and deformation affected by that variability, and in turn, how do the mechanic of the system modulate phenotypic variation? We highlight a few key factors, including environmental temperature, embryo size and environmental chemistry that might perturb the mechanics of morphogenesis in natural populations. Then we discuss several ways in which mechanics-including feedback from mechanical cues-might influence intra-specific variation in morphogenesis. To understand morphogenesis it will be necessary to consider whole-organism, environment and evolutionary scales because these larger scales present the challenges that developmental mechanisms have evolved to cope with. Studying the variation organisms express and the variation organisms experience will aid in deciphering the causes of birth defects.},

abstract = {Primitive streak formation in the chick embryo involves significant coordinated cell movement lateral to the streak, in addition to the posterior-anterior movement of cells in the streak proper. Cells lateral to the streak are observed to undergo 'polonaise movements', i.e. two large counter-rotating vortices, reminiscent of eddies in a fluid. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for these movement patterns which relies on chemotactic signals emitted by a dipolar configuration of cells in the posterior region of the epiblast. The 'chemotactic dipole' consists of adjacent regions of cells emitting chemo-attractants and chemo-repellents. We motivate this idea using a mathematical analogy between chemotaxis and electrostatics, and test this idea using large-scale computer simulations. We implement active cell response to both neighboring mechanical interactions and chemotactic gradients using the Subcellular Element Model. Simulations show the emergence of large-scale vortices of cell movement. The length and time scales of vortex formation are in reasonable agreement with experimental data. We also provide quantitative estimates for the robustness of the chemotaxis dipole mechanism, which indicate that the mechanism has an error tolerance of about 10% to variation in chemotactic parameters, assuming that only 1% of the cell population is involved in emitting signals. This tolerance increases for larger populations of cells emitting signals.},

Behavioral changes, such as morphological deformation, proliferation and migration, are striking in many multicellular processes such as morphogenesis, wound healing and cancer progression. Cell-based modeling of these phenomena requires algorithms that can capture active cell behavior and their emergent tissue-level phenotypes. In this paper, we report on extensions of the subcellular element model to model active biomechanical subcellular processes. These processes lead to emergent cell and tissue level phenotypes at larger scales, including (i) adaptive shape deformations in cells responding to slow stretching, (ii) viscous flow of embryonic tissues, and (iii) streaming patterns of chemotactic cells in epithelial-like sheets. In each case, we connect our simulation results to recent experiments.},

abstract = {During Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis, the follicular epithelium that envelops the germline cyst gives rise to an elaborate eggshell, which houses the future embryo and mediates its interaction with the environment. A prominent feature of the eggshell is a pair of dorsal appendages, which are needed for embryo respiration. Morphogenesis of this structure depends on broad, a zinc-finger transcription factor, regulated by the EGFR pathway. While much has been learned about the mechanisms of broad regulation by EGFR, current understanding of processes that shape the spatial pattern of broad expression is incomplete. We propose that this pattern is defined by two different phases of EGFR activation: an early, posterior-to-anterior gradient of EGFR signaling sets the posterior boundary of broad expression, while the anterior boundary is set by a later phase of EGFR signaling, distributed in a dorsoventral gradient. This model can explain the wild-type pattern of broad in D. melanogaster, predicts how this pattern responds to genetic perturbations, and provides insight into the mechanisms driving diversification of eggshell patterning. The proposed model of the broad expression pattern can be used as a starting point for the quantitative analysis of a large number of gene expression patterns in Drosophila oogenesis.},

Surprisingly the underlying principles of mesoderm layer formation are very similar in evolutionarily distant species like the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and the frog, Xenopus laevis, in which the molecular and the cellular basis of mesoderm layer formation have been extensively studied. Complementary expression of growth factors in the ectoderm and their receptors in the mesoderm act to orient cellular protrusive activities and direct cell movement, leading to radial cell intercalation and the spreading of the mesoderm layer. This mechanism is contrasted with generic physical mechanisms of tissue spreading that consider the adhesive and physical properties of the cells and tissues. Both mechanisms need to be integrated to orchestrate mesenchymal morphogenesis.},

We show that the ECM moves as a composite material, whereby distinct molecular components as well as spatially separated layers exhibit similar displacements. Using scanning wide field and confocal microscopy we show that the velocity field of ECM displacement is smooth in space and that ECM movements are correlated even at locations separated by several hundred micrometers. Velocity vectors, however, strongly fluctuate in time. The autocorrelation time of the velocity fluctuations is less than a minute. Suppression of the fluctuations yields a persistent movement pattern that is shared among embryos at equivalent stages of development. The high resolution of the velocity fields allows a detailed spatio-temporal characterization of important morphogenetic processes, especially tissue dynamics surrounding the embryonic organizer (Hensen's node).},

In many cases, a chemotactic mechanism is employed, where cells move up or down a previously generated attractive or repulsive gradient of signalling molecules. Recent studies revealed the existence of systems with isotropic chemoattractant expression in the lateral line primordium of zebrafish. Here we propose a mechanism for a cell collective, which actively modulates an isotropically expressed ligand and encodes an initial symmetry breaking in its velocity. We derive a closed solution for the velocity and identify an optimal length that maximizes the tissues' velocity. A length dependent polar gradient is identified, its use for pro-neuromast deposition is shown by simulations and a critical time for cell deposition is derived. Experiments to verify this model are suggested.},

abstract = {Fluctuations in the size of the apical cell surface have been associated with apical constriction and tissue invagination. However, it is currently not known if apical oscillatory behaviors are a unique property of constricting cells or if they constitute a universal feature of the force balance between cells in multicellular tissues. Here, we set out to determine whether oscillatory cell behaviors occur in parallel with cell intercalation during the morphogenetic process of axis elongation in the Drosophila embryo. We applied multi-color, time-lapse imaging of living embryos and SIESTA, an integrated tool for automated and semi-automated cell segmentation, tracking, and analysis of image sequences. Using SIESTA, we identified cycles of contraction and expansion of the apical surface in intercalating cells and characterized them at the molecular, cellular, and tissue scales. We demonstrate that apical oscillations are anisotropic, and this anisotropy depends on the presence of intact cell-cell junctions and spatial cues provided by the anterior-posterior patterning system. Oscillatory cell behaviors during axis elongation are associated with the hierarchical assembly and disassembly of contractile actomyosin structures at the medial cortex of the cell, with actin localization preceding myosin II and with the localization of both proteins preceding changes in cell shape. We discuss models to explain how the architecture of cytoskeletal networks regulates their contractile behavior and the mechanisms that give rise to oscillatory cell behaviors in intercalating cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: During vertebrate gastrulation, cell polarization and migration are core components in the cellular rearrangements that lead to the formation of the three germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Previous studies have implicated the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway in controlling cell morphology and movement during gastrulation. However, cell polarization and directed cell migration are reduced but not completely abolished in the absence of Wnt/PCP signals; this observation indicates that other signaling pathways must be involved.

RESULTS: We show that Phosphoinositide 3-Kinases (PI3Ks) are required at the onset of zebrafish gastrulation in mesendodermal cells for process formation and cell polarization. Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) functions upstream of PI3K, while Protein Kinase B (PKB), a downstream effector of PI3K activity, localizes to the leading edge of migrating mesendodermal cells. In the absence of PI3K activity, PKB localization and cell polarization are strongly reduced in mesendodermal cells and are followed by slower but still highly coordinated and directed movements of these cells.

CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a novel role of a signaling pathway comprised of PDGF, PI3K, and PKB in the control of morphogenetic cell movements during gastrulation. Furthermore, our findings provide insight into the relationship between cell polarization and directed cell migration at the onset of zebrafish gastrulation.},

Models can be confirmed by the demonstration of agreement between observation and prediction, but confirmation is inherently partial. Complete confirmation is logically precluded by the fallacy of affirming the consequent and by incomplete access to natural phenomena. Models can only be evaluated in relative terms, and their predictive value is always open to question. The primary value of models is heuristic.},

abstract = {Collective cell migration requires maintenance of adhesive contacts between adjacent cells, coordination of polarized cell protrusions, and generation of propulsive traction forces. We demonstrate that mechanical force applied locally to C-cadherins on single Xenopus mesendoderm cells is sufficient to induce polarized cell protrusion and persistent migration typical of individual cells within a collectively migrating tissue. Local tension on cadherin adhesions induces reorganization of the keratin intermediate filament network toward these stressed sites. Plakoglobin, a member of the catenin family, is localized to cadherin adhesions under tension and is required for both mechanoresponsive cell behavior and assembly of the keratin cytoskeleton at the rear of these cells. Local tugging forces on cadherins occur in vivo through interactions with neighboring cells, and these forces result in coordinate changes in cell protrusive behavior. Thus, cadherin-dependent force-inducible regulation of cell polarity in single mesendoderm cells represents an emergent property of the intact tissue.},

abstract = {Wnt11 plays a central role in tissue morphogenesis during vertebrate gastrulation, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which Wnt11 exerts its effects remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Wnt11 functions during zebrafish gastrulation by regulating the cohesion of mesodermal and endodermal (mesendodermal) progenitor cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that Wnt11 activity in this process is mediated by the GTPase Rab5, a key regulator of early endocytosis, as blocking Rab5c activity in wild-type embryos phenocopies slb/wnt11 mutants, and enhancing Rab5c activity in slb/wnt11 mutant embryos rescues the mutant phenotype. In addition, we find that Wnt11 and Rab5c control the endocytosis of E-cadherin and are required in mesendodermal cells for E-cadherin-mediated cell cohesion. Together, our results suggest that Wnt11 controls tissue morphogenesis by modulating E-cadherin-mediated cell cohesion through Rab5c, a novel mechanism of Wnt signaling in gastrulation.},

abstract = {During embryonic development, certain tissues stream to their destinations by liquidlike spreading movements. According to the 'differential adhesion hypothesis', these movements are guided by cell-adhesion-generated tissue surface tensions (sigmas), operating in the same manner as surface tensions do in the mutual spreading behavior of immiscible liquids, among which the liquid of lower surface tension is always the one that spreads over its partner. In order to conduct a direct physical test of the 'differential adhesion hypothesis', we have measured the sigmas of aggregates of five chick embryonic tissues, using a parallel plate compression apparatus specifically designed for this purpose, and compared the measured values with these tissues' mutual spreading behaviors. We show that aggregates of each of these tissues behave for a time as elasticoviscous liquids with characteristic surface tension values. Chick embryonic limb bud mesoderm (sigma = 20.1 dyne/cm) is enveloped by pigmented epithelium (sigma = 12.6 dyne/cm) which, in turn, is enveloped by heart (sigma = 8.5 dyne/cm) which, in turn, is enveloped by liver (sigma = 4.6 dyne/cm) which, in turn, is enveloped by neural retina (sigma = 1.6 dyne/cm). Thus, as predicted, the tissues' surface tension values fall in the precise sequence required to account for their mutual envelopment behavior.},

abstract = {When a dielectric object is placed between two opposed, nonfocused laser beams, the total force acting on the object is zero but the surface forces are additive, thus leading to a stretching of the object along the axis of the beams. Using this principle, we have constructed a device, called an optical stretcher, that can be used to measure the viscoelastic properties of dielectric materials, including biologic materials such as cells, with the sensitivity necessary to distinguish even between different individual cytoskeletal phenotypes. We have successfully used the optical stretcher to deform human erythrocytes and mouse fibroblasts. In the optical stretcher, no focusing is required, thus radiation damage is minimized and the surface forces are not limited by the light power. The magnitude of the deforming forces in the optical stretcher thus bridges the gap between optical tweezers and atomic force microscopy for the study of biologic materials.},

abstract = {The relationship between the mechanical properties of cells and their molecular architecture has been the focus of extensive research for decades. The cytoskeleton, an internal polymer network, in particular determines a cell's mechanical strength and morphology. This cytoskeleton evolves during the normal differentiation of cells, is involved in many cellular functions, and is characteristically altered in many diseases, including cancer. Here we examine this hypothesized link between function and elasticity, enabling the distinction between different cells, by using a microfluidic optical stretcher, a two-beam laser trap optimized to serially deform single suspended cells by optically induced surface forces. In contrast to previous cell elasticity measurement techniques, statistically relevant numbers of single cells can be measured in rapid succession through microfluidic delivery, without any modification or contact. We find that optical deformability is sensitive enough to monitor the subtle changes during the progression of mouse fibroblasts and human breast epithelial cells from normal to cancerous and even metastatic state. The surprisingly low numbers of cells required for this distinction reflect the tight regulation of the cytoskeleton by the cell. This suggests using optical deformability as an inherent cell marker for basic cell biological investigation and diagnosis of disease.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties of cells are dominated by the cytoskeleton, a crosslinked network of protein filaments. Unlike synthetic polymer networks, the cell cytoskeleton is a highly dynamical system due to the on-off kinetics of the crosslinking proteins and the polymerization--depolymerization cycles of the filaments themselves. More remarkably, some of the crosslinkers are motor proteins, which are capable of generating forces and directional motion between the filaments by consuming chemical energy. Thus, the cell cytoskeleton is a highly complex and active polymer gel, which is responsible for the unique cell mechanical properties, which make it crawl, divide and assemble to higher functional units. This complexity of the cytoskeleton demands the development of novel experimental techniques as well as theoretical ideas. This review will deal with the recent technological, experimental and theoretical developments in the field of cell mechanics, and current trends. It will be shown that despite the cytoskeletal complexity, cells show some very general rheological properties.},

abstract = {The axial bodyplan of Drosophila melanogaster is determined during a process called morphogenesis. Shortly after fertilization, maternal bicoid mRNA is translated into Bicoid (Bcd). This protein establishes a spatially graded morphogen distribution along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the embryo. Bcd initiates AP axis determination by triggering expression of gap genes that subsequently regulate each other's expression to form a precisely controlled spatial distribution of gene products. Reaction-diffusion models of gap gene expression on a 1D domain have previously been used to infer complex genetic regulatory network (GRN) interactions by optimizing model parameters with respect to 1D gap gene expression data. Here we construct a finite element reaction-diffusion model with a realistic 3D geometry fit to full 3D gap gene expression data. Though gap gene products exhibit dorsal-ventral asymmetries, we discover that previously inferred gap GRNs yield qualitatively correct AP distributions on the 3D domain only when DV-symmetric initial conditions are employed. Model patterning loses qualitative agreement with experimental data when we incorporate a realistic DV-asymmetric distribution of Bcd. Further, we find that geometry alone is insufficient to account for DV-asymmetries in the final gap gene distribution. Additional GRN optimization confirms that the 3D model remains sensitive to GRN parameter perturbations. Finally, we find that incorporation of 3D data in simulation and optimization does not constrain the search space or improve optimization results.},

abstract = {Vertebrae and ribs arise from embryonic tissues called somites. Somites arise sequentially from the unsegmented embryo tail, called presomitic mesoderm (PSM). The pace of somite formation is controlled by gene products such as hairy and enhancer of split 7 (Hes7) whose expression oscillates in the PSM. In addition to the cyclic genes, there is a gradient of fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) mRNA from posterior to anterior PSM. Recent experiments have shown that in the absence of Fgf signaling, Hes7 oscillations in the anterior and posterior PSM are lost. On the other hand, Notch mutants reduce the amplitude of posterior Hes7 oscillations and abolish anterior Hes7 oscillations. To understand these phenotypes, we delineated and simulated a logical and a delay differential equation (DDE) model with similar network topology in wild-type and mutant situations. Both models reproduced most wild-type and mutant phenotypes suggesting that the chosen topology is robust to explain these phenotypes. Numerical continuation of the model showed that even in the wild-type situation, the system changed from sustained to damped, i.e. a Hopf bifurcation occurred, when the Fgf concentration decreased in the PSM. This numerical continuation analysis further indicated that the most sensitive parameters for the oscillations are the parameters of Hes7 followed by those of Lunatic fringe (Lfng) and Notch1. In the wild-type, the damping of Hes7 oscillations was not so strong so that cells reached the new somites before they lose Hes7 oscillations. By contrast, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1) conditional knock-out (cKO) mutant simulation, Notch signaling was not able to maintain sustained Hes7 oscillations. Our analysis suggests that Fgf signaling makes cells enter an oscillatory state of Hes7 expression. After moving to the anterior PSM, where Fgf signaling is missing, Notch signaling compensates the damping of Hes7 oscillations in the anterior PSM.},

abstract = {During embryonic vasculogenesis, endothelial precursor cells of mesodermal origin known as angioblasts assemble into a characteristic network pattern. Although a considerable amount of markers and signals involved in this process have been identified, the mechanisms underlying the coalescence of angioblasts into this reticular pattern remain unclear. Various recent studies hypothesize that autocrine regulation of the chemoattractant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is responsible for the formation of vascular networks in vitro. However, the autocrine regulation hypothesis does not fit well with reported data on in vivo early vascular development. In this study, we propose a mathematical model based on the alternative assumption that endodermal VEGF signalling activity, having a paracrine effect on adjacent angioblasts, is mediated by its binding to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Detailed morphometric analysis of simulated networks and images obtained from in vivo quail embryos reveals the model mimics the vascular patterns with high accuracy. These results show that paracrine signalling can result in the formation of fine-grained cellular networks when mediated by angioblast-produced ECM. This lends additional support to the theory that patterning during early vascular development in the vertebrate embryo is regulated by paracrine signalling.},

abstract = {The formation and maintenance of boundaries between neighbouring groups of embryonic cells is vital for development because groups of cells with distinct functions must often be kept physically separated. Furthermore, because cells at the boundary often take on important signalling functions by acting as organizing centres, boundary shape and integrity can also control the outcome of many downstream patterning events. Recent experimental findings and theoretical descriptions have shed new light on classic questions about boundaries. In particular, in the past couple of years the role of forces acting in epithelial tissues to maintain boundaries has emerged as a new principle in understanding how early pattern is made into permanent anatomy.},

abstract = {Absolute levels of gene expression in bacteria are observed to vary over as much as six orders of magnitude. Thermodynamic models have been proposed as a tool to describe the expression levels of a given transcriptional circuit. In this context, it is essential to understand both the limitations and linear range of the different methods for measuring gene expression and to determine to what extent measurements from different reporters can be directly compared with one aim being the stringent testing of theoretical descriptions of gene expression. In this article, we compare two protein reporters by measuring both the absolute level of expression and fold-change in expression using the fluorescent protein EYFP and the enzymatic reporter β-galactosidase. We determine their dynamic and linear range and show that they are interchangeable for measuring mean levels of expression over four orders of magnitude. By calibrating these reporters such that they can be interpreted in terms of absolute molecular counts, we establish limits for their applicability: autofluorescence on the lower end of expression for EYFP (at ∼10 molecules per cell) and interference with cellular growth on the high end for β-galactosidase (at ∼20,000 molecules per cell). These qualities make the reporters complementary and necessary when trying to experimentally verify the predictions from the theoretical models.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is growing rapidly leading to the discovery and replication of many new disease loci. Combining results from multiple GWAS datasets may potentially strengthen previous conclusions and suggest new disease loci, pathways or pleiotropic genes. However, no database or centralized resource currently exists that contains anywhere near the full scope of GWAS results.

METHODS: We collected available results from 118 GWAS articles into a database of 56,411 significant SNP-phenotype associations and accompanying information, making this database freely available here. In doing so, we met and describe here a number of challenges to creating an open access database of GWAS results. Through preliminary analyses and characterization of available GWAS, we demonstrate the potential to gain new insights by querying a database across GWAS.

RESULTS: Using a genomic bin-based density analysis to search for highly associated regions of the genome, positive control loci (e.g., MHC loci) were detected with high sensitivity. Likewise, an analysis of highly repeated SNPs across GWAS identified replicated loci (e.g., APOE, LPL). At the same time we identified novel, highly suggestive loci for a variety of traits that did not meet genome-wide significant thresholds in prior analyses, in some cases with strong support from the primary medical genetics literature (SLC16A7, CSMD1, OAS1), suggesting these genes merit further study. Additional adjustment for linkage disequilibrium within most regions with a high density of GWAS associations did not materially alter our findings. Having a centralized database with standardized gene annotation also allowed us to examine the representation of functional gene categories (gene ontologies) containing one or more associations among top GWAS results. Genes relating to cell adhesion functions were highly over-represented among significant associations (p < 4.6 x 10(-14)), a finding which was not perturbed by a sensitivity analysis.

CONCLUSION: We provide access to a full gene-annotated GWAS database which could be used for further querying, analyses or integration with other genomic information. We make a number of general observations. Of reported associated SNPs, 40% lie within the boundaries of a RefSeq gene and 68% are within 60 kb of one, indicating a bias toward gene-centricity in the findings. We found considerable heterogeneity in information available from GWAS suggesting the wider community could benefit from standardization and centralization of results reporting.},

One of these is found within an endogenous retroviral element and is associated with major histocompatibility allele human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*5701, whereas a second is located near the HLA-C gene.

Using experimental evolution, we show that key steps in this transition could have occurred quickly. We subjected the unicellular yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to an environment in which we expected multicellularity to be adaptive. We observed the rapid evolution of clustering genotypes that display a novel multicellular life history characterized by reproduction via multicellular propagules, a juvenile phase, and determinate growth. The multicellular clusters are uniclonal, minimizing within-cluster genetic conflicts of interest. Simple among-cell division of labor rapidly evolved. Early multicellular strains were composed of physiologically similar cells, but these subsequently evolved higher rates of programmed cell death (apoptosis), an adaptation that increases propagule production. These results show that key aspects of multicellular complexity, a subject of central importance to biology, can readily evolve from unicellular eukaryotes.},

abstract = {How control of subcellular events in single cells determines morphogenesis on the scale of the tissue is largely unresolved. The stereotyped cross-midline mitoses of progenitors in the zebrafish neural keel provide a unique experimental paradigm for defining the role and control of single-cell orientation for tissue-level morphogenesis in vivo. We show here that the coordinated orientation of individual progenitor cell division in the neural keel is the cellular determinant required for morphogenesis into a neural tube epithelium with a single straight lumen. We find that Scribble is required for oriented cell division and that its function in this process is independent of canonical apicobasal and planar polarity pathways. We identify a role for Scribble in controlling clustering of α-catenin foci in dividing progenitors. Loss of either Scrib or N-cadherin results in abnormally oriented mitoses, reduced cross-midline cell divisions, and similar neural tube defects. We propose that Scribble-dependent nascent cell-cell adhesion clusters between neuroepithelial progenitors contribute to define orientation of their cell division. Finally, our data demonstrate that while oriented mitoses of individual cells determine neural tube architecture, the tissue can in turn feed back on its constituent cells to define their polarization and cell division orientation to ensure robust tissue morphogenesis.},

abstract = {Neurulation is a morphogenetic event par excellence. During this highly choreographed four-dimensional process, a flat sheet of ectoderm is transformed into an elongated tubular rudiment, the neural tube, which exhibits rostro-caudal and mediolateral regionalization. Many tissues interact during neurulation to induce and regionalize the neuroectoderm and to produce the morphogenetic forces that drive neurulation. Such forces are generated by fundamental cell behaviors such as changes in cell shape, position and number. In addition, morphoregulatory molecules expressed during neurulation underlie induction and patterning of the forming neuraxis. Despite recent advances in our understanding of neurulation, neural tube defects continue to be a major health care concern. Further research, utilizing a panoply of approaches, is necessary to resolve this issue. Thus, although we are beginning to come to closure in terms of understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for normal neural tube formation, 'coming to closure' is exactly the problem that requires resolution to prevent these devastating birth defects.},

abstract = {Environmental and genetic aberrations lead to neural tube closure defects (NTDs) in 1 out of every 1,000 births. Mouse and frog models for these birth defects have indicated that Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2, also known as Strabismus) and other components of planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling might control neurulation by promoting the convergence of neural progenitors to the midline. Here we show a novel role for PCP signalling during neurulation in zebrafish. We demonstrate that non-canonical Wnt/PCP signalling polarizes neural progenitors along the anteroposterior axis. This polarity is transiently lost during cell division in the neural keel but is re-established as daughter cells reintegrate into the neuroepithelium. Loss of zebrafish Vangl2 (in trilobite mutants) abolishes the polarization of neural keel cells, disrupts re-intercalation of daughter cells into the neuroepithelium, and results in ectopic neural progenitor accumulations and NTDs. Remarkably, blocking cell division leads to rescue of trilobite neural tube morphogenesis despite persistent defects in convergence and extension. These results reveal a function for PCP signalling in coupling cell division and morphogenesis at neurulation and indicate a previously unrecognized mechanism that might underlie NTDs.},

Genetic screens in Drosophila melanogaster pioneered the discovery of core PCP factors, which regulate the orientation of hairs on wings and facets in eyes. Recent genetic evidence shows that the Fz/PCP pathway is conserved in vertebrates and is crucial for disparate processes as gastrulation and sensory cell orientation. Fz/PCP signalling depends on complex interactions between core components, leading to their asymmetric distribution and ultimately polarized activity in a cell. Whereas several mechanistic aspects of PCP have been uncovered, the global coordination of this polarization remains debated.},

abstract = {In the neural plate and neural tube in the trunk region of the zebrafish embryo, dividing cells are oriented parallel to the plane of the neuroepithelium, while in neural keel/rod, cells divide perpendicular to it. This change in the orientation of mitosis is brought about by a 90 degrees rotation of the mitotic spindle. As the two halves of the neural primordium in keel/rod stage are in apposition, the perpendicular orientation of mitoses in this stage determines that daughter cells become allocated to both sides of the neural tube. To assess the role played by cell junctions in controlling the orientation of dividing cells, we studied the expression of components of adherens and tight junctions in the neuroepithelial cells. We find that these proteins are distributed irregularly at the neural plate stage and become polarised apically in the cell membrane only during the keel/rod stage. The stereotypic orientation of mitoses is perturbed only weakly upon loss of function of the cell junction components ASIP and aPKClambda, suggesting that mitotic orientation depends in part on the integrity of cell junctions and the polarity of the epithelium as a whole. However, the 90-degree rotation of the spindle does not require perfectly polarised cell junctions between the neuroepithelial cells.},

As a proof of principle, we have dynamically profiled No tail a (Ntla)-dependent genes at different stages of axial mesoderm development in zebrafish, discovering discrete sets of transcripts that are coincident with either notochord cell fate commitment or differentiation. Our studies reveal new regulators of notochord development and the sequential activation of distinct transcriptomes within a cell lineage by a single transcriptional factor and demonstrate how optically controlled chemical tools can dissect developmental processes with spatiotemporal precision.},

abstract = {Embryonic development is controlled by networks of interacting regulatory genes. The individual linkages of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are customarily validated by functional cis-regulatory analysis, but an additional approach to validation is to rewire GRN circuitry to test experimentally predictions derived from network structure. Here we use this synthetic method to challenge specific predictions of the sea urchin embryo endomesoderm GRN. Expression vectors generated by in vitro recombination of exogenous sequences into BACs were used to cause elements of a nonskeletogenic mesoderm GRN to be deployed in skeletogenic cells and to detect their effects. The result of reengineering the regulatory circuitry in this way was to divert the developmental program of these cells from skeletogenesis to pigment cell formation, confirming a direct prediction of the GRN. In addition, the experiment revealed previously undetected cryptic repression functions.},

The major approaches in the history of research on vertebrate embryos have tended to exploit different species, though there are long-term continuities too. Early nineteenth-century embryologists worked on surrogates for humans and began to explore the range of vertebrate embryogenesis; late nineteenth-century Darwinists hunted exotic ontogenies; around 1900 experimentalists favored living embryos in which they could easily intervene; reproductive scientists tackled farm animals and human beings; after World War II developmental biologists increasingly engineered species for laboratory life; and proponents of evo-devo have recently challenged the resulting dominance of a few models. Decisions about species have depended on research questions, biological properties, supply lines, and, not least, on methods. Nor are species simply chosen; embryology has transformed them even as they have profoundly shaped the science.},

abstract = {Mesoderm formation is critical for the establishment of the animal body plan and in Drosophila requires the snail gene. This report concerns the cloning and expression pattern of the structurally similar gene snail1 from zebrafish. In situ hybridization shows that the quantity of snail1 RNA increases at the margin of the blastoderm in cells that involute during gastrulation. As gastrulation begins, snail1 RNA disappears from the dorsal axial mesoderm and becomes restricted to the paraxial mesoderm and the tail bud. snail1 RNA increases in cells that define the posterior border of each somite and then disappears when somitic cells differentiate. Later in development, expression appears in cephalic neural crest derivatives. Many snail1-expressing cells were missing from mutant spadetail embryos and the quantity of snail1 RNA was greatly reduced in mutant no tail embryos. The work presented here suggests that snail1 is involved in morphogenetic events during gastrulation, somitogenesis and development of the cephalic neural crest, and that no tail may act as a positive regulator of snail1.},

abstract = {The Snail genes are implicated in processes that involve cell movement, both during embryonic development and tumour progression. In teleosts, the vertebrate Snail1 gene is represented by two distinct genes, snail1a and snail1b (previously snail1 and snail2). These genes are expressed in complementary mesodermal domains and their combined expression matches that of their mammalian counterpart. By analysing their loss and gain of function, we found that the most-anterior axial mesendodermal cells, the precursors of the polster, move in a cohesive manner directed by the activity of snail1a- and snail1b-expressing cells surrounding these precursors. The cell-autonomous function of Snail1 proteins regulates cell motility and influences the behaviour of Snail-negative neighbouring cells. Snail1a is required by the prechordal plate for it to reach its normal position, whereas Snail1b controls the acquisition of its normal shape. These non-redundant functions of Snail1a and Snail1b in controlling axial mesendoderm migration comply with the duplication-degeneration-complementation model, and indicate that Snail genes not only act as inducers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, but also as more general regulators of cell adhesion and movement.},

abstract = {The vertebrate planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway consists of conserved PCP and ciliary genes. During development, the PCP pathway regulates convergent extension (CE) and uniform orientation of sensory hair cells in the cochlea. It is not clear how these diverse morphogenetic processes are regulated by a common set of PCP genes. Here, we show that cellular contacts and geometry change drastically and that the dynamic expression of N-cadherin and E-cadherin demarcates sharp boundaries during cochlear extension. The conditional knockout of a component of the adherens junctions, p120-catenin, leads to the reduction of E-cadherin and N-cadherin and to characteristic cochlear CE defects but not misorientation of hair cells. The specific CE defects in p120-catenin mutants are in contrast to associated CE and hair cell misorientation defects observed in common PCP gene mutants. Moreover, the loss-of-function of a conserved PCP gene, Vangl2, alters the dynamic distribution of N-cadherin and E-cadherin in the cochlea and causes similar abnormalities in cellular morphology to those found in p120-catenin mutants. Conversely, we found that Pcdh15 interacts genetically with PCP genes to regulate the formation of polar hair bundles, but not CE defects in the cochlea. Together, these results indicate that the vertebrate PCP pathway regulates CE and hair cell polarity independently and that a p120-catenin-dependent mechanism regulates CE of the cochlea.},

abstract = {Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we define a network of Her/Hes dimers underlying transcriptional negative feedback within the zebrafish segmentation clock. Some of the dimers do not appear to be DNA-binding, whereas those dimers that do interact with DNA have distinct preferences for cis regulatory sequences. Dimerization is specific, with Hes6 serving as the hub of the network. Her1 binds DNA only as a homodimer but will also dimerize with Hes6. Her12 and Her15 bind DNA both as homodimers and as heterodimers with Hes6. Her7 dimerizes strongly with Hes6 and weakly with Her15. This network structure engenders specific network dynamics and imparts greater influence to the Her7 node. Computational analysis supports the hypothesis that Her7 disproportionately influences the availability of Hes6 to heterodimerize with other Her proteins. Genetic experiments suggest that this regulation is important for operation of the network. Her7 therefore has two functions within the zebrafish segmentation clock. Her7 acts directly within the delayed negative feedback as a DNA-binding heterodimer with Hes6. Her7 also has an emergent function, independent of DNA binding, in which it modulates network topology via sequestration of the network hub.},

abstract = {Directed cell migration is important for normal animal development and physiology. The process can also be subverted by tumor cells to invade other tissues and to metastasize. Some cells, such as leukocytes, migrate individually; other cells migrate together in groups or sheets, called collective cell migration. Guidance of individually migrating cells depends critically on subcellularly localized perception and transduction of signals. For collective cell migration, guidance could result from cells within a group achieving different signaling levels, with directionality then encoded in the collective rather than in individual cells. Here we subject this collective guidance hypothesis to direct tests, using migration of border cells during Drosophila oogenesis as our model system. These cells normally use two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), PDGF/VEGF-related receptor (PVR) and EGFR, to read guidance cues secreted by the oocyte. Elevated but delocalized RTK signaling in one cell of the cluster was achieved by overexpression of PVR in the absence of ligand or by overexpression of fusion receptors unable to detect Drosophila ligands; alternatively, Rac was photoactivated centrally within a single cell. In each case, one cell within the group was in a high signal state, whereas others were in low signal states. The high signal cell directed cluster movement effectively. We conclude that differences in cell signaling states are sufficient to direct collective migration and are likely a substantial contributor to normal guidance. Cell signaling states could manifest as differences in gene expression or metabolite levels and thus differ substantially from factors normally considered when analyzing eukaryotic cell guidance.},

abstract = {The yolk syncytial layer (YSL) in the zebrafish embryo is a multinucleated syncytium essential for embryo development, but the molecular mechanisms underlying YSL formation remain largely unknown. Here we show that zebrafish solute carrier family 3 member 2 (Slc3a2) is expressed specifically in the YSL and that slc3a2 knockdown causes severe YSL defects including clustering of the yolk syncytial nuclei and enhanced cell fusion, accompanied by disruption of microtubule networks. Expression of a constitutively active RhoA mimics the YSL phenotypes caused by slc3a2 knockdown, whereas attenuation of RhoA or ROCK activity rescues the slc3a2-knockdown phenotypes. Furthermore, slc3a2 knockdown significantly reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src, and overexpression of a constitutively active Src restores the slc3a2-knockdown phenotypes. Our data demonstrate a signaling pathway regulating YSL formation in which Slc3a2 inhibits the RhoA/ROCK pathway via phosphorylation of c-Src to modulate YSL microtubule dynamics. This work illuminates processes at a very early stage of zebrafish embryogenesis and more generally informs the mechanism of cell dynamics during syncytium formation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The power of a microarray experiment derives from the identification of genes differentially regulated across biological conditions. To date, differential regulation is most often taken to mean differential expression, and a number of useful methods for identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes or gene sets are available. However, such methods are not able to identify many relevant classes of differentially regulated genes. One important example concerns differentially co-expressed (DC) genes.

RESULTS: We propose an approach, gene set co-expression analysis (GSCA), to identify DC gene sets. The GSCA approach provides a false discovery rate controlled list of interesting gene sets, does not require that genes be highly correlated in at least one biological condition and is readily applied to data from individual or multiple experiments, as we demonstrate using data from studies of lung cancer and diabetes.

AVAILABILITY: The GSCA approach is implemented in R and available at www.biostat.wisc.edu/ approximately kendzior/GSCA/.

abstract = {The fact that some organisms are able to regenerate organs of the correct shape and size following amputation is particularly fascinating, but the mechanism by which this occurs remains poorly understood. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) caudal fin has emerged as a model system for the study of bone development and regeneration. The fin comprises 16 to 18 bony rays, each  containing multiple joints along its proximodistal axis that give rise to segments. Experimental observations on fin ray growth,  regeneration and joint formation have been described, but no unified theory has yet been put forward to explain how growth and joint patterns are controlled. We present a model for the control of fin ray growth during development and regeneration, integrated with a model for joint pattern formation, which is in agreement with published, as well as new, experimental data. We propose that fin ray growth and joint patterning are coordinated through the interaction of three morphogens. When the 
model is extended to incorporate multiple rays across the fin, it also accounts for how the caudal fin acquires its shape during 
development, and regains its correct size and shape following amputation.},

Experimental tests through partial leaf ablation support this model and allow reevaluation of previous experimental studies. Our model allows a range of observed leaf shapes to be generated and predicts observed clone patterns in different species.

In plants, the first visible sign of leaf formation is a bulge on the flank of the shoot apical meristem. Bulging results from local relaxation of cell walls, which causes them to yield to internal hydrostatic pressure. By manipulation of tissue tension in combination with quantitative live imaging and finite-element modeling, we found that the slow-growing area at the shoot tip is substantially strain-stiffened compared with surrounding fast-growing tissue.

abstract = {Epiboly, the spreading and the thinning of the blastoderm to cover the yolk cell and close the blastopore in fish embryos, is central to the process of gastrulation. Despite its fundamental importance, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control this coordinated cell movement. By a combination of knockdown studies and rescue experiments in zebrafish (Danio rerio), we show that epiboly relies on the molecular networking of syntenin with syndecan heparan sulphate proteoglycans, which act as co-receptors for adhesion molecules and growth factors. Furthermore, we show that the interaction of syntenin with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and with the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6), which regulate the endocytic recycling of syndecan, is necessary for epiboly progression. Analysis of the earliest cellular defects suggests a role for syntenin in the autonomous vegetal expansion of the yolk syncytial layer and the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in extra-embryonic tissues, but not in embryonic cell fate determination. This study identifies the importance of the syntenin-syndecan-PIP2-Arf6 complex for the progression of fish epiboly and establishes its key role in directional cell movements during early development.},

Zebrafish pou5f1 deficient maternal and zygotic spiel ohne grenzen (MZspg) mutant embryos develop severe gastrulation defects, are dorsalized, and defective in endoderm formation. Here we analyze in detail gastrulation defects, which are manifested by a severe delay in epiboly progression. All three embryonic lineages in MZspg embryos behave abnormally during epiboly: the yolk cell forms an altered array of cortical microtubules and F-Actin, with large patches of microtubule free areas; the enveloping layer (EVL) is delayed in the coordinated cell shape changes of marginal cells, that may be mediated by F-Actin; the deep layer cells (DEL), forming the embryo proper, are non-autonomously affected in their motility and do not enter the space opening by epiboly of the EVL. Analysis of adhesiveness as well as high resolution in vivo time lapse image analysis of DEL cells suggests changed adhesive properties and inability to migrate properly on EVL and yolk syncytial layer (YSL) surfaces. Our data further reveal that during epiboly the EVL may actively probe the YSL by filopodia formation, rather than just being passively pulled vegetalwards. Our findings on the effect of Pou5f1 on cell behavior may be relevant to understand stem cell behavior and tumorigenesis involving Pou5f1.},

abstract = {Cell intercalation and cell shape changes drive notochord morphogenesis in the African frog, Xenopus laevis. Experimental observations show that cells elongate mediolaterally and intercalate between one another, causing the notochord to lengthen and narrow. Descriptive observations provide few clues as to the mechanisms that coordinate and drive these cell movements. It is possible that a few rules governing cell behavior could orchestrate the shaping of the entire tissue. We test this hypothesis by constructing a computer model of the tissue to investigate how rules governing cell motility and cell-cell interactions can account for the major features of notochord morphogenesis. These rules are drawn from the literature on in vitro cell studies and experimental observations of notochord cell behavior. The following types of motility rules are investigated: (1) refractory tissue boundaries that inhibit cell motility, (2) statistical persistence of motion, (3) contact inhibition of protrusion between cells, and (4) polarized and nonpolarized protrusive activity. We show that only the combination of refractory boundaries, contact inhibition and polarized protrusive activity reproduces normal notochord development. Guided by these rules, cells spontaneously align into a parallel array of elongating cells. Self alignment optimizes the geometric conditions for polarized protrusive activity by progressively minimizing contact inhibition between cells. Cell polarization, initiated at refractory tissue boundaries, spreads along successive cell rows into the tissue interior as cells restrict and constrain their neighbors' directional bias. The model demonstrates that several experimentally observed intrinsic cell behaviors, operating simultaneously, may underlie the generation of coordinated cell movements within the developing notochord.},

Other models suggest that differential clearance underlies different signaling ranges. To test these models, we measured the biophysical properties of the Nodal/Lefty activator/inhibitor system during zebrafish embryogenesis. Analysis of Nodal and Lefty gradients revealed that Nodals have a shorter range than Lefty proteins. Pulse-labeling analysis indicated that Nodals and Leftys have similar clearance kinetics, whereas fluorescence recovery assays revealed that Leftys have a higher effective diffusion coefficient than Nodals. These results indicate that differential diffusivity is the major determinant of the differences in Nodal/Lefty range and provide biophysical support for reaction-diffusion models of activator/inhibitor-mediated patterning.},

abstract = {Many morphogenetic processes are accomplished by coordinated cell rearrangements. These rearrangements are accompanied by substantial shifts in the neighbor relationships between cells. Here we propose a model for studying morphogenesis in epithelial sheets by directed cell neighbor change. Our model describes cell rearrangements by accounting for the balance of forces between neighboring cells within an epithelium. Cell rearrangement and cell shape changes occur when these forces are not in mechanical equilibrium. We will show that cell rearrangement within the epidermal enveloping layer (EVL) of the teleost fish Fundulus during epiboly can be explained solely in terms of the balance of forces generated among constituent epithelial cells. Within a cell, we account for circumferential elastic forces and the force generated by hydrostatic and osmotic pressure. The model treats epithelial cells as two-dimensional polygons where the mechanical forces are applied to the polygonal nodes. A cell node protrudes or contracts when the nodal forces are not in mechanical equilibrium. In an epithelial sheet, adjacent cells share common boundary nodes; in this way, mechanical force is transmitted from cell to cell, mimicking junctional coupling. These junctional nodes can slide, and nodes may appear or disappear, so that the number of polygonal sides is variable. Computer graphics allows us to compare numerical simulations of the model with time-lapse cinemicroscopy of cell rearrangements in the living embryo, and data obtained from fixed and silver stained embryos. By manipulating the mechanical properties of the model cells we can study the conditions necessary to reproduce normal cell behavior during Fundulus epiboly. We find that simple stress relaxation is sufficient to account for cell rearrangements among interior cells of the EVL when they are isotropically contractile. Experimental observations show that the number of EVL marginal cells continuously decreases throughout epiboly. In order for the simulation to reproduce this behavior, cells at the EVL boundary must generate protrusive forces rather than contractile tension forces. Therefore, the simulation results suggest that the mechanical properties of EVL marginal cells at their leading edge must be quite different from EVL interior cells.},

abstract = {The basic characteristics of embryonic process throughout Metazoa are considered with focus on those aspects that provide insight into how cell specification occurs in the initial stages of development. There appear to be three major types of embryogenesis: Type 1, a general form characteristic of most invertebrate taxa of today, in which lineage plays an important role in the spatial organization of the early embryo, and cell specification occurs in situ, by both autonomous and conditional mechanisms; Type 2, the vertebrate form of embryogenesis, which proceeds by mechanisms that are essentially independent of cell lineage, in which diffusible morphogens and extensive early cell migration are particularly important; Type 3, the form exemplified by long germ band insects in which several different regulatory mechanisms are used to generate precise patterns of nuclear gene expression prior to cellularization. Evolutionary implications of the phylogenetic distribution of these types of embryogenesis are considered. Regionally expressed homeodomain regulators are utilized in all three types of embryo, in similar ways in later and postembryonic development, but in different ways in early embryonic development. A specific downstream molecular function for this class of regulator is proposed, based on evidence obtained in vertebrate systems. This provides a route by which to approach the comparative regulatory strategies underlying the three major types of embryogenesis.},

abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,160(3) particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

They are composed of two ring-like F-actin structures that form at the deep cell and enveloping layer margins of the blastoderm and a punctate actin band that develops in the external yolk syncytial layer. Treatment with cytochalasin B or the calcium chelator dibromo-BAPTA results in the disruption of all three of these actin-based structures, leading to the slowing or immediate arrest of epiboly, respectively, followed by a failure of yolk cell occlusion and the eventual lysis of the embryo through the vegetal pole region. We suggest, therefore, that these structures function in the occlusion of the vegetal portion of the yolk cell during the latter stages of epiboly. Possible roles for these new structures, their modulation by Ca2+, as well as the functions of other previously described F-actin--based structures observed throughout epiboly, are discussed.},

abstract = {Bcl-2 family members are key regulators of apoptosis. Their involvement in other cellular processes has been so far overlooked. We have studied the role of the Bcl-2 homolog Nrz in the developing zebrafish. Nrz was found to be localized to the yolk syncytial layer, a region containing numerous mitochondria and ER membranes. Nrz knockdown resulted in developmental arrest before gastrulation, due to free Ca(2+) increase in the yolk cell, activating myosin light chain kinase, which led to premature contraction of actin-myosin cables in the margin and separation of the blastomeres from the yolk cell. In the yolk syncytial layer, Nrz appears to prevent the release of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum by directly interacting with the IP3R1 Ca(2+) channel. Thus, the Bcl-2 family may participate in early development, not only by controlling apoptosis but also by acting on cytoskeletal dynamics and cell movements via Ca(2+) fluxes inside the embryo.},

abstract = {Long-distance cell migration is an important feature of embryonic development, adult morphogenesis and cancer, yet the mechanisms that drive subpopulations of cells to distinct targets are poorly understood. Here, we use the embryonic neural crest (NC) in tandem with theoretical studies to evaluate model mechanisms of long-distance cell migration. We find that a simple chemotaxis model is insufficient to explain our experimental data. Instead, model simulations predict that NC cell migration requires leading cells to respond to long-range guidance signals and trailing cells to short-range cues in order to maintain a directed, multicellular stream. Experiments confirm differences in leading versus trailing NC cell subpopulations, manifested in unique cell orientation and gene expression patterns that respond to non-linear tissue growth of the migratory domain. Ablation experiments that delete the trailing NC cell subpopulation reveal that leading NC cells distribute all along the migratory pathway and develop a leading/trailing cellular orientation and gene expression profile that is predicted by model simulations. Transplantation experiments and model predictions that move trailing NC cells to the migratory front, or vice versa, reveal that cells adopt a gene expression profile and cell behaviors corresponding to the new position within the migratory stream. These results offer a mechanistic model in which leading cells create and respond to a cell-induced chemotactic gradient and transmit guidance information to trailing cells that use short-range signals to move in a directional manner.},

abstract = {Despite extensive study, the earliest steps of vertebrate axis formation are only beginning to be elucidated. We previously showed that asymmetric localization of maternal transcripts of the conserved zebrafish TGFβ factor Squint (Sqt) in 4-cell stage embryos predicts dorsal, preceding nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. Cell ablations and antisense oligonucleotides that deplete Sqt lead to dorsal deficiencies, suggesting that localized maternal sqt functions in dorsal specification. However, based upon analysis of sqt and Nodal signaling mutants, the function and mechanism of maternal sqt was debated. Here, we show that sqt RNA may function independently of Sqt protein in dorsal specification. sqt insertion mutants express localized maternal sqt RNA. Overexpression of mutant/non-coding sqt RNA and, particularly, the sqt 3'UTR, leads to ectopic nuclear β-catenin accumulation and expands dorsal gene expression. Dorsal activity of sqt RNA requires Wnt/β-catenin but not Oep-dependent Nodal signaling. Unexpectedly, sqt ATG morpholinos block both sqt RNA localization and translation and abolish nuclear β-catenin, providing a mechanism for the loss of dorsal identity in sqt morphants and placing maternal sqt RNA upstream of β-catenin. The loss of early dorsal gene expression can be rescued by the sqt 3'UTR. Our findings identify new non-coding functions for the Nodal genes and support a model wherein sqt RNA acts as a scaffold to bind and deliver/sequester maternal factors to future embryonic dorsal.},

abstract = {Understanding the complex regulatory networks underlying development and evolution of multi-cellular organisms is a major problem in biology. Computational models can be used as tools to extract the regulatory structure and dynamics of such networks from gene expression data. This approach is called reverse engineering. It has been successfully applied to many gene networks in various biological systems. However, to reconstitute the structure and non-linear dynamics of a developmental gene network in its spatial context remains a considerable challenge. Here, we address this challenge using a case study: the gap gene network involved in segment determination during early development of Drosophila melanogaster. A major problem for reverse-engineering pattern-forming networks is the significant amount of time and effort required to acquire and quantify spatial gene expression data. We have developed a simplified data processing pipeline that considerably increases the throughput of the method, but results in data of reduced accuracy compared to those previously used for gap gene network inference. We demonstrate that we can infer the correct network structure using our reduced data set, and investigate minimal data requirements for successful reverse engineering. Our results show that timing and position of expression domain boundaries are the crucial features for determining regulatory network structure from data, while it is less important to precisely measure expression levels. Based on this, we define minimal data requirements for gap gene network inference. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of reverse-engineering with much reduced experimental effort. This enables more widespread use of the method in different developmental contexts and organisms. Such systematic application of data-driven models to real-world networks has enormous potential. Only the quantitative investigation of a large number of developmental gene regulatory networks will allow us to discover whether there are rules or regularities governing development and evolution of complex multi-cellular organisms.},

Although stable patterns can be easily obtained by numerical simulations, a stability or bifurcation analysis is hindered by the fact that the model is defined by an algorithm and not a dynamical system, mainly because new active elements are added at each step, and thus the dimension of the "natural" phase space is not conserved. Here a construction is presented by which a well defined dynamical system can be obtained, and a bifurcation analysis can be carried out. Stable and unstable patterns are found by an analytical relation, in which the roles of different growth mechanisms determining the shape is clarified. Then bifurcations are studied, especially anomalous scenarios due to discontinuities embedded in the original model. Finally, an explicit formula for evaluation of the Jacobian, and thus the eigenvalues, is given. It is likely that problems of the above type often arise in biology, and especially in morphogenesis, where growing systems are modeled.},

abstract = {The vertebrate body plan is established during gastrulation, when cells move inwards to form the mesodermal and endodermal germ layers. Signals from a region of dorsal mesoderm, which is termed the organizer, pattern the body axis by specifying the fates of neighbouring cells. The organizer is itself induced by earlier signals. Although members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and Wnt families have been implicated in the formation of the organizer, no endogenous signalling molecule is known to be required for this process. Here we report that the zebrafish squint (sqt) and cyclops (cyc) genes have essential, although partly redundant, functions in organizer development and also in the formation of mesoderm and endoderm. We show that the sqt gene encodes a member of the TGF-beta superfamily that is related to mouse nodal. cyc encodes another nodal-related proteins, which is consistent with our genetic evidence that sqt and cyc have overlapping functions. The sqt gene is expressed in a dorsal region of the blastula that includes the extraembryonic yolk syncytial layer (YSL). The YSL has been implicated as a source of signals that induce organizer development and mesendoderm formation. Misexpression of sqt RNA within the embryo or specifically in the YSL induces expanded or ectopic dorsal mesoderm. These results establish an essential role for nodal-related signals in organizer development and mesendoderm formation.},

abstract = {The organizer is formed in an equatorial sector of the blastula stage amphibian embryo by cells that have responded to two maternal agents: a general mesoendoderm inducer (involving the TFG-beta signaling pathway) and a dorsal modifier (probably involving the Wnt signaling pathway). The meso-endoderm inducer is secreted by most vegetal cells, those containing maternal materials that had been localized in the vegetal hemisphere of the oocyte during oogenesis. As a consequence of the inducer's distribution and action, the competence domains of prospective ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm are established in an animal-to-vegetal order in the blastula. The dorsal modifier signal is secreted by a sector of cells of the animal and vegetal hemispheres on one side of the blastula. These cells contain maternal materials transported there in the first cell cycle from the vegetal pole of the egg along microtubules aligned by cortical rotation. The Nieuwkoop center is the region of blastula cells secreting both maternal signals, and hence specifying the organizer in an equatorial sector. Final steps of organizer formation at the late blastula or early gastrula stage may involve locally secreted zygotic signals as well. At the gastrula stage, the organizer secretes a variety of zygotic proteins that act as antagonists to various members of the BMP and Wnt families of ligands, which are secreted by cells of the competence domains surrounding the organizer. BMPs and Wnts favor ventral development, and cells near the organizer are protected from these agents by the organizer's inducers. The nearby cells are derepressed in their inherent capacity for dorsal development, which is apparent in the neural induction of the ectoderm, dorsalization of the mesoderm, and anteriorization of the endoderm. The organizer also engages in extensive specialized morphogenesis, which brings it within range of responsive cell groups. It also self-differentiates to a variety of axial tissues of the body.},

abstract = {Cell polarity is an essential feature of many animal cells. It is critical for epithelial formation and function, for correct partitioning of fate-determining molecules, and for individual cells to chemotax or grow in a defined direction. For some of these processes, the position and orientation of the mitotic spindle must be coupled to cell polarity for correct positioning of daughter cells and inheritance of localised molecules. Recent work in several different systems has led to the realisation that similar mechanisms dictate the establishment of polarity and subsequent spindle positioning in many animal cells. Microtubules and conserved PAR proteins are essential mediators of cell polarity, and mitotic spindle positioning depends on heterotrimeric G protein signalling and the microtubule motor protein dynein.},

abstract = {Cell movements in Fundulus blastoderms during gastrulation were studied utilizing time-lapse cinemicrography and electron microscopy. Time-lapse films reveal that cells of the enveloping layer undulate and sometimes separate briefly but remain together in a cohesive layer. During epiboly, the marginal enveloping layer cells move over the periblast as it expands over the yolk sphere. Movement occurs as a result of ruffled membrane activity of the free borders of the marginal cells. Deep blastomeres become increasingly active during blastula and gastrula stages. Lobopodia project from the blastomeres in blastulae and adhere to other cells in gastrulae, giving the cells traction for movement. Contact specializations are formed by the lateral adjacent plasma membranes of enveloping layer cells. An apical junction is characterized by an intercellular gap of 60-75 A. Below this contact, the plasma membranes are separated by 120 A or more. In mid-gastrulae, cytoplasmic fibrils occur adjacent to some apical junctions, and small desmosomes appear below the apical junction. Septate desmosomes also appear at this time. A junction with an intercellular gap of 60 A occurs between marginal enveloping layer cells and periblast. Contacts between deep blastomeres become numerous in gastrulae and consist of contacts at the crests of surface undulations, short areas of contact in which the plasma membranes are 60 or 120 A apart, and long regions characterized by a 200-A intercellular gap. Lobopodia contact other blastomeres only in gastrulae. These junctions contain a 200-A intercellular space. Some deep blastomeres are in contact with the tips of periblast microvilli. The mechanism of epiboly in Fundulus is discussed and reevaluated in terms of these observations. The enveloping layer is adherent to the margin of the periblast and moves over it as a coherent cellular sheet. Periblast epiboly involves a controlled flow of cytoplasm from the thicker periblast into the thinner yolk cytoplasmic layer with which it is continuous. Deep cells move by adhering to each other, to the inner surface of the enveloping layer, and to the periblast.},

abstract = {The mechanism of locomotion of deep cells of Fundulus heteroclitus was studied in vivo during gastrulation with the aid of time-lapse cinemicrography (Nomarski differential interference contrast optics), scanning electron microscopy of cells known to be moving at the time of fixation, and cell culture. These are our findings: (1) Deep cells usually move rapidly, at about 10--15 μm/min, regardless of whether they move by blebbing or spreading. Evidence suggests that this high speed is associated with weak adhesion of the trailing edge: it remains rounded, without large retraction fibers, and it advances continuously with advance of the leading edge, not sporadically, as it would if it adhered strongly. (2) In contrast, when stationary cells in close contact separate, they remain connected at first by large retraction fibers, suggesting strong punctate adhesions. (3) Fundulus deep cells appear to move in two ways: a) protrusion of blebs, followed by much cytoplasmic flow; b) spreading of lamellipodia, preceded by filopodia and frequent cell shortening. Locomotion by shortening of a long lobopodium is really a form of spreading movement, since the tip of a lobopodium always spreads. (4) Filopodia were not found except at the leading edge of a spreading lamellipodium and often spread themselves; perhaps filopodia and lamellipodia are interconvertible. (5) A lamellipodial margin may form undulations in vivo that move backward like ruffles in vitro. (6) At all times, whether stationary or moving, the surface of any given deep cell is smooth, raising unanswered questions concerning the source of surface for their rapid protrusive activity.},

abstract = {Silver nitrate staining of blastoderms of Fundulus heteroclitus gastrulae shows that the number of marginal cells of the enveloping layer (EVL) is reduced from 160 to 25 during epiboly. To determine whether this decrease in the number of marginal cells was due to ingression, cell death, or rearrangement of cells, marginal and submarginal regions of the late gastrula were observed directly by time-lapse cinemicrography. Marginal cells rearrange to occupy submarginal positions by first narrowing their boundary with the external yolk syncytial layer (E-YSL), thus becoming tapered in shape. Then, the narrowed marginal boundary retracts from the E-YSL and moves submarginally in the plane of the epithelium. Concurrently, the marginal cells on both sides come into apposition; no gap or break appears in the circum-apical continuity of the epithelial sheet. Marginal cells leave the margin of the EVL during epiboly at a rate of about six per hour. The rate of movement of the EVL cells with respect to one another is about 0.5 to 1.0 micron/min at 21 degrees C. Submarginal cells rearrange in a similar fashion. Although no protrusive activity was seen at the lateral aspects of rearranging cells, the tapering or narrowing associated with rearrangement was accompanied by formation of microfolds on their apical surfaces, and separating or recently separated submarginal cells form "flowers" of microfolds on their apices adjacent to the site of separation. Morphometric analysis shows that about half the narrowing of the margin of the EVL during epiboly is accounted for by cell rearrangement and the other half by the associated tapering and narrowing. These results suggest that epiboly of the EVL may have an active component as well as a passive one.},

abstract = {Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling generates subcellular asymmetry along an axis orthogonal to the epithelial apical-basal axis. Through a poorly understood mechanism, cell clones that have mutations in some PCP signaling components, including some, but not all, alleles of the receptor frizzled, cause polarity disruptions of neighboring wild-type cells, a phenomenon referred to as domineering nonautonomy. Here, a contact-dependent signaling hypothesis, derived from experimental results, is shown by reaction-diffusion, partial differential equation modeling and simulation to fully reproduce PCP phenotypes, including domineering nonautonomy, in the Drosophila wing. The sufficiency of this model and the experimental validation of model predictions reveal how specific protein-protein interactions produce autonomy or domineering nonautonomy.},

abstract = {Recent studies show that plant organ positioning may be mediated by localized concentrations of the plant hormone auxin. Auxin patterning in the shoot apical meristem is in turn brought about by the subcellular polar distribution of the putative auxin efflux mediator, PIN1. However, the question of what signals determine PIN1 polarization and how this gives rise to regular patterns of auxin concentration remains unknown. Here we address these questions by using mathematical modeling combined with confocal imaging. We propose a model that is based on the assumption that auxin influences the polarization of its own efflux within the meristem epidermis. We show that such a model is sufficient to create regular spatial patterns of auxin concentration on systems with static and dynamic cellular connectivities, the latter governed by a mechanical model. We also optimize parameter values for the PIN1 dynamics by using a detailed auxin transport model, for which parameter values are taken from experimental estimates, together with a template consisting of cell and wall compartments as well as PIN1 concentrations quantitatively extracted from confocal data. The model shows how polarized transport can drive the formation of regular patterns.},

We discuss recent evidence that the vertebrate non-canonical Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway, known to directly function in polarizing the movements of intercalating cells, is also involved in the localized assembly of extracellular matrix (ECM). These cell-ECM interactions, in turn, are necessary for expression of the oriented, polarized cell intercalation. The mechanism of PCP/ECM interactions, their molecular signaling, and their mechanical consequences for morphogenesis are discussed with the goal of identifying important unsolved issues.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) control the dynamic spatial patterns of regulatory gene expression in development. Thus, in principle, GRN models may provide system-level, causal explanations of developmental process. To test this assertion, we have transformed a relatively well-established GRN model into a predictive, dynamic Boolean computational model. This Boolean model computes spatial and temporal gene expression according to the regulatory logic and gene interactions specified in a GRN model for embryonic development in the sea urchin. Additional information input into the model included the progressive embryonic geometry and gene expression kinetics. The resulting model predicted gene expression patterns for a large number of individual regulatory genes each hour up to gastrulation (30 h) in four different spatial domains of the embryo. Direct comparison with experimental observations showed that the model predictively computed these patterns with remarkable spatial and temporal accuracy. In addition, we used this model to carry out in silico perturbations of regulatory functions and of embryonic spatial organization. The model computationally reproduced the altered developmental functions observed experimentally. Two major conclusions are that the starting GRN model contains sufficiently complete regulatory information to permit explanation of a complex developmental process of gene expression solely in terms of genomic regulatory code, and that the Boolean model provides a tool with which to test in silico regulatory circuitry and developmental perturbations.},

abstract = {Positional information has been suggested to play a central role in pattern formation during development. The strong version of positional information states that there is a cell parameter, positional value, which is related to position as in a coordinate system and which determines cell differentiation. A weaker version merely emphasises position as a key determinant in cell development and differentiation. There is evidence for boundaries and orthogonal axes playing an important role in positional systems. A positional signal is distinguished from an inductive interaction because the former specifies multiple states, confers polarity, and can act over a long range. A gradient in a diffusible morphogen is just one way of specifying position. There is now good evidence in several systems for substances which may be the morphogen for positional signalling. The product of the bicoid gene in early Drosophila development is the best prospect. Retinoic acid is unique in its ability to alter positional value and may also be a morphogen. The best evidence for positional value, a concept fundamental to positional information, remains a biological assay based on grafting. The idea of positional value uncouples differentiation and position, and allows considerable freedom for patterning. It is not clear whether positional value or differentiation involves a combinatorial mechanism. Interpretation of positional information remains a central problem. There is good evidence that cells can respond differentially to less than a two-fold change in concentration of a chemical signal. It may be that interpretation involves listing the sites at which a particular class of cell differentiation will occur. The problem is made less severe when blocks of cells are specified together as in mechanisms based on an isomorphic prepattern. Isomorphic prepatterns could establish repeated structures which are equivalent and which are then made non-equivalent by positional information. This would enable local differences to develop. The combination of these two mechanisms may be wide-spread. There is evidence that positional signals within a single animal and in related animals are conserved. It is not clear just how wide this conservation is, but it is at phylotypic stages, rather than in eggs, that similarity might be expected. It is nevertheless impressive that the polar coordinate model can be applied to regulation in systems as diverse as insects, vertebrates and protozoa. The molecular basis of positional signalling is just becoming accessible; the molecular basis of positional value is still awaited. A brief personal history of positional information is provided in an appendix.},

abstract = {Cell proliferation affects both cellular geometry and topology in a growing tissue, and hence rules for cell division are key to understanding multicellular development. Epithelial cell layers have for long times been used to investigate how cell proliferation leads to tissue-scale properties, including organism-independent distributions of cell areas and number of neighbors. We use a cell-based two-dimensional tissue growth model including mechanics to investigate how different cell division rules result in different statistical properties of the cells at the tissue level. We focus on isotropic growth and division rules suggested for plant cells, and compare the models with data from the Arabidopsis shoot. We find that several division rules can lead to the correct distribution of number of neighbors, as seen in recent studies. In addition we find that when also geometrical properties are taken into account other constraints on the cell division rules result. We find that division rules acting in favor of equally sized and symmetrically shaped daughter cells can best describe the statistical tissue properties.},

An analogy between viscoelastic fluids and certain properties of embryonic tissues helps interpret these phenomena. The values of tissue-specific surface tensions are consistent with the equilibrium configurations that the Differential Adhesion Hypothesis predicts such tissues reach after sorting and spreading. Here we extend the fluid analogy to cellular kinetics. The same formalism applies to recent experiments on the kinetics of phase ordering in two-phase fluids. Our results provide biologically relevant information on the strength of binding between cell adhesion molecules under near-physiological conditions.},

In this article, we develop a mathematical formulation of a new version of the Clock and Wavefront model proposed by Pourqui{\'e} and co-workers (Dubrulle, J., McGrew, M.J., Pourqui{\'e}, O., 2001. FGF signalling controls somite boundary position and regulates segmentation clock control of spatiotemporal Hox gene activation. Cell 106, 219-232). Dynamic expression of FGF8 in the presomitic mesoderm constitutes the wavefront of determination which sweeps along the body axis interacting as it moves with the segmentation clock to gate cells into somites. We also show that the model can mimic the anomalies formed when progression of the wavefront is disturbed and make some experimental predictions that can be used to test the hypotheses underlying the model.},

abstract = {The relationships between fluid shear stress, a physiologically relevant mechanical force in the circulatory system, and pinocytosis (fluid-phase endocytosis) were investigated in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells using a specially designed apparatus. Continuous exposure to steady shear stresses (1-15 dyn/cm2) in laminar flow stimulated time- and amplitude-dependent increases in pinocytotic rate which returned to control levels after several hours. After 48 h continuous exposure to steady shear stress, removal to static conditions also resulted in a transient increase in pinocytotic rate, suggesting that temporal fluctuations in shear stress may influence endothelial cell function. Endothelial pinocytotic rates remained constant during exposure to rapidly oscillating shear stress at near physiological frequency (1 Hz) in laminar flow. In contrast, however, a sustained elevation of pinocytotic rate occurred when cells were subjected to fluctuations in shear stress amplitude (3-13 dyn/cm2) of longer cycle time (15 min), suggesting that changes in blood flow of slower periodicity may influence pinocytotic vesicle formation. As determined by [3H]thymidine autoradiography, neither steady nor oscillating shear stress stimulated the proliferation of confluent endothelial cells. These observations indicate that: (a) alterations in fluid shear stress can significantly influence the rate of formation of pinocytotic vesicles in vascular endothelial cells, (b) this process is force- and time-dependent and shows accommodation, (c) certain patterns of fluctuation in shear stress result in sustained elevation of pinocytotic rate, and (d) shear stresses can modulate endothelial pinocytosis independent of growth stimulation. These findings are relevant to (i) transendothelial transport and the metabolism of macromolecules in normal endothelium and (ii) the role of hemodynamic factors in the localization of atherosclerotic lesions in vivo.},

According to the 'clock-and-wave-front' model mesodermal segmentation of vertebrate embryos is regulated by a 'segmentation clock', which oscillates with a period of about 2h in mice, and a 'wave front' moving back with the growing caudal end of the presomitic mesoderm. The clock is realised through cycling expression of genes such as Hes1 and Hes7, whose gene products repress the transcription of their encoding genes in a negative feedback loop. By coupling the decay of the Hes1 mRNA to a gradient with the same features and mechanism of formation as the mesodermal Fgf8 gradient we can simulate typical features of the dynamic expression pattern of Hes1 in the presomitic mesoderm. Furthermore, our program is able to synchronise Hes1 oscillations in thousands of cells through simulated Delta-Notch signalling interactions.},

abstract = {The formation of somites in the course of vertebrate segmentation is governed by an oscillator known as the segmentation clock, which is characterized by a period ranging from 30 min to a few hours depending on the organism. This oscillator permits the synchronized activation of segmentation genes in successive cohorts of cells in the presomitic mesoderm in response to a periodic signal emitted by the segmentation clock, thereby defining the future segments. Recent microarray experiments [Dequeant, M.L., Glynn, E., Gaudenz, K., Wahl, M., Chen, J., Mushegian, A., Pourquie, O., 2006. A complex oscillating network of signaling genes underlies the mouse segmentation clock. Science 314, 1595-1598] indicate that the Notch, Wnt and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling pathways are involved in the mechanism of the segmentation clock. By means of computational modeling, we investigate the conditions in which sustained oscillations occur in these three signaling pathways. First we show that negative feedback mediated by the Lunatic Fringe protein on intracellular Notch activation can give rise to periodic behavior in the Notch pathway. We then show that negative feedback exerted by Axin2 on the degradation of beta-catenin through formation of the Axin2 destruction complex can produce oscillations in the Wnt pathway. Likewise, negative feedback on FGF signaling mediated by the phosphatase product of the gene MKP3/Dusp6 can produce oscillatory gene expression in the FGF pathway. Coupling the Wnt, Notch and FGF oscillators through common intermediates can lead to synchronized oscillations in the three signaling pathways or to complex periodic behavior, depending on the relative periods of oscillations in the three pathways. The phase relationships between cycling genes in the three pathways depend on the nature of the coupling between the pathways and on their relative autonomous periods. The model provides a framework for analyzing the dynamics of the segmentation clock in terms of a network of oscillating modules involving the Wnt, Notch and FGF signaling pathways.},

In zebrafish, neighboring cells interact by Delta-Notch signaling to realize synchronization. Under Delta-Notch, however, a cell with a high expression of the segmentation clock gene tends to suppress its expression in adjacent cells, which might produce spatial heterogeneity instead of synchronized oscillation. Here we studied the conditions under which pre-somitic mesoderm cells show synchronized oscillation of gene expression mathematically. We adopted a model that explicitly considers the kinetics of the mRNA and proteins of the segmentation clock gene and cell-cell interaction via Delta-Notch signaling. From statistical study of a model with randomly generated parameters, we revealed how the likelihood that the system generates stable synchronized oscillation depends on the rate of each reaction in the gene-protein kinetics.},

The core of the model is a negative feedback loop centered around the Axin2 protein. Axin2 is activated by beta-catenin, which in turn is degraded by a complex of GSK3beta and Axin2. The model produces oscillatory states of the involved constituents with typical time periods of a few hours (ultradian oscillations). The oscillations are robust to changes in parameter values and are often spiky, where low concentration values of beta-catenin are interrupted by sharp peaks. Necessary for the oscillations is the saturated degradation of Axin2. Somite formation in chick and mouse embryos is controlled by a spatial Wnt gradient which we introduce in the model through a time-dependent decrease in Wnt3a ligand level. We find that the oscillations disappear as the ligand concentration decreases, in agreement with observations on embryos.},

These models are then used to make novel predictions that provide further insight into the processes involved, which can be tested experimentally to either confirm or rule out the validity of the computational models. This review highlights two fundamental challenges: (a) to understand the feedback between mechanics of growth and chemical or molecular signaling, and (b) to design models that span and integrate single cell behavior with tissue development. We review different approaches to model plant growth and discuss a variety of model types that can be implemented to demonstrate how the interplay between computational modeling and experimentation can be used to explore the morphodynamics of plant development.},

The production of prostacyclin by primary human endothelial cell cultures subjected to pulsatile and steady flow shear stress was measured. The onset of flow led to a sudden increase in prostacyclin production, which decreased to a steady rate within several minutes. The steady-state production rate of cells subjected to pulsatile shear stress was more than twice that of cells exposed to steady shear stress and 16 times greater than that of cells in stationary culture.},

abstract = {The concept of positional information proposes that cells acquire positional values as in a coordinate system, which they interpret by developing in particular ways to give rise to spatial patterns. Some of the best evidence for positional information comes from regeneration experiments, and the patterning of the leg and antenna in Drosophila and the vertebrate limb. Central problems are how positional information is set up, how it is recorded, and then how it is interpreted by the cells. A number of models have been proposed for the setting up of positional gradients, and most are based on diffusion of a morphogen and its interactions with extracellular molecules. It is argued that diffusion may not be reliable mechanism. There are also mechanisms based on timing. There is no good evidence for the quantitative aspects of any of the gradients and details how they are set up. The way in which a signalling gradient regulates differential gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner also raises several mechanistic issues.},

Genetic factors are thought to specify patterns of growth and other behaviors to drive morphogenesis. Here, we show that tissue form itself can feed back to regulate patterns of proliferation. Using micro-fabrication to control the organization of sheets of cells, we demonstrated the emergence of stable patterns of proliferative foci. Regions of concentrated growth corresponded to regions of high tractional stress generated within the sheet, as predicted by a finite-element model of multicellular mechanics and measured directly by using a micromechanical force sensor array. Inhibiting actomyosin-based tension or cadherin-mediated connections between cells disrupted the spatial pattern of proliferation. These findings demonstrate the existence of patterns of mechanical forces that originate from the contraction of cells, emerge from their multicellular organization, and result in patterns of growth. Thus, tissue form is not only a consequence but also an active regulator of tissue growth.},

Here we show that the pattern of branching morphogenesis of three-dimensional (3D) engineered epithelial tissues is controlled in part by gradients of endogenous mechanical stress. We used microfabrication to build model mammary epithelial tissues of defined geometry that branched in a stereotyped pattern when induced with growth factors. Branches initiated from sites of high mechanical stress within the tissues, as predicted numerically and measured directly using 3D traction force microscopy. Branch sites were defined by activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), inhibition of which disrupted morphogenesis. Stress, FAK activation, and branching were all altered by manipulating cellular contractility, matrix stiffness, intercellular cohesion and tissue geometry. These data suggest that the pattern and magnitude of mechanical stress across epithelial tissues cooperate with biochemical signals to specify branching pattern.},

abstract = {Axis elongation in Drosophila occurs through polarized cell rearrangements driven by actomyosin contractility. Myosin II promotes neighbor exchange through the contraction of single cell boundaries, while the contraction of myosin II structures spanning multiple pairs of cells leads to rosette formation. Here we show that multicellular actomyosin cables form at a higher frequency than expected by chance, indicating that cable assembly is an active process. Multicellular cables are sites of increased mechanical tension as measured by laser ablation. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments show that myosin II is stabilized at the cortex in regions of increased tension. Myosin II is recruited in response to an ectopic force and relieving tension leads to a rapid loss of myosin, indicating that tension is necessary and sufficient for cortical myosin localization. These results demonstrate that myosin II dynamics are regulated by tension in a positive feedback loop that leads to multicellular actomyosin cable formation and efficient tissue elongation.},

Here we develop an appropriate experimental approach to ascertain the existence and the physiological relevance of this phenomenon. By combining the use of magnetic tweezers with in vivo laser ablation, we locally control physiologically relevant deformations in wild-type Drosophila embryonic tissues. We demonstrate that the deformations caused by germ band extension upregulate Twist expression in the stomodeal primordium. We find that stomodeal compression triggers Src42A-dependent nuclear translocation of Armadillo/beta-catenin, which is required for Twist mechanical induction in the stomodeum. Finally, stomodeal-specific RNAi-mediated silencing of Twist during compression impairs the differentiation of midgut cells, resulting in larval lethality. These experiments show that mechanically induced Twist upregulation in stomodeal cells is necessary for subsequent midgut differentiation.},

abstract = {Mechanotransduction refers to the transformation of physical forces into chemical signals. It generally involves stretch-sensitive channels or conformational change of cytoskeleton-associated proteins. Mechanotransduction is crucial for the physiology of several organs and for cell migration. The extent to which mechanical inputs contribute to development, and how they do this, remains poorly defined. Here we show that a mechanotransduction pathway operates between the body-wall muscles of Caenorhabditis elegans and the epidermis. This pathway involves, in addition to a Rac GTPase, three signalling proteins found at the hemidesmosome: p21-activated kinase (PAK-1), the adaptor GIT-1 and its partner PIX-1. The phosphorylation of intermediate filaments is one output of this pathway. Tension exerted by adjacent muscles or externally exerted mechanical pressure maintains GIT-1 at hemidesmosomes and stimulates PAK-1 activity through PIX-1 and Rac. This pathway promotes the maturation of a hemidesmosome into a junction that can resist mechanical stress and contributes to coordinating the morphogenesis of epidermal and muscle tissues. Our findings suggest that the C. elegans hemidesmosome is not only an attachment structure, but also a mechanosensor that responds to tension by triggering signalling processes. We suggest that similar pathways could promote epithelial morphogenesis or wound healing in other organisms in which epithelial cells adhere to tension-generating contractile cells.},

Physical forces regulate a large array of physiological processes, and dysregulation of mechanical responses contributes to major human diseases. A survey of both specialized and widely expressed mechanosensitive systems suggests that physical forces provide a general means of altering protein conformation to generate signals. Specialized systems differ mainly in having acquired efficient mechanisms for transferring forces to the mechanotransducers.},

abstract = {Cells sense their physical surroundings through mechanotransduction - that is, by translating mechanical forces and deformations into biochemical signals such as changes in intracellular calcium concentration or by activating diverse signalling pathways. In turn, these signals can adjust cellular and extracellular structure. This mechanosensitive feedback modulates cellular functions as diverse as migration, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and is crucial for organ development and homeostasis. Consequently, defects in mechanotransduction - often caused by mutations or misregulation of proteins that disturb cellular or extracellular mechanics - are implicated in the development of various diseases, ranging from muscular dystrophies and cardiomyopathies to cancer progression and metastasis.},

The structure suggests a molecular mechanism for adhesion between cells by classical cadherins, and it provides a new framework for understanding both cis (same cell) and trans (juxtaposed cell) cadherin interactions. The trans adhesive interface is a twofold symmetric interaction defined by a conserved tryptophan side chain at the membrane-distal end of a cadherin molecule from one cell, which inserts into a hydrophobic pocket at the membrane-distal end of a cadherin molecule from the opposing cell.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:In Xenopus, the endoderm germ layer is derived from the vegetal blastomeres of cleavage-stage embryos. Cell transplantation experiments have revealed that the endodermal fate becomes gradually fixed during the late blastula stages. Sox17alpha, Mix.1, Mixer and GATA-4 encode vegetal zygotic transcription factors with endoderm-inducing activity. The accumulation of their transcripts during the late blastula stages may cause determination of the endodermal fate. VegT, a T-box transcription factor, the maternal transcripts of which are vegetally localised, is also required for endoderm formation.

RESULTS:We analysed the events leading to the progressive accumulation of the transcripts for Sox17alpha, Mix.1, Mixer and GATA-4. Two phases could be distinguished in the endodermal programme. In phase 1, Sox17alpha, Mix.1, and the genes encoding transforming growth factor beta-related signalling molecules Xnr1, Xnr2 and Derri{\`e}re were activated cell-autonomously at around the mid-blastula transition (MBT) by maternal determinants. In phase 2, TGFbeta signalling, possibly involving Xnr1, Xnr2 and Derri{\`e}re, led to the activation of Mixer and GATA-4 in late blastula stages and to the reinforcement of the expression of Sox17alpha and Mix.1. Overexpression of VegT in animal caps triggered a developmental programme qualitatively similar to that observed in vegetal blastomeres, except that Xnr1 and GATA-4 were not activated by the early gastrula stage.

CONCLUSIONS:Our results support a two-step model for endoderm determination between fertilisation and the onset of gastrulation. The initial cell-autonomous activation of early endodermal genes by maternal determinants including, but not limited to, VegT is relayed by the action of zygotic TGFbetas such as Xnr1, Xnr2 and Derri{\`e}re.},

abstract = {Preferential loading of the complementary bioluminescent (f-aequorin) and fluorescent (Calcium Green-1 dextran) Ca(2+) reporters into the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) of zebrafish embryos, revealed the generation of stochastic patterns of fast, short-range, and slow, long-range Ca(2+) waves that propagate exclusively through the external YSL (E-YSL). Starting abruptly just after doming (~4.5h post-fertilization: hpf), and ending at the shield stage (~6.0hpf) these distinct classes of waves propagated at mean velocities of ~50 and ~4μm/s, respectively. Although the number and pattern of these waves varied between embryos, their initiation site and arcs of propagation displayed a distinct dorsal bias, suggesting an association with the formation and maintenance of the nascent dorsal-ventral axis. Wave initiation coincided with a characteristic clustering of YSL nuclei (YSN), and their associated perinuclear ER, in the E-YSL. Furthermore, the inter-YSN distance (IND) appeared to be critical such that Ca(2+) wave propagation occurred only when this was <~8μm; an IND >~8μm was coincidental with wave termination at shield stage. Treatment with the IP(3)R antagonist, 2-APB, the Ca(2+) buffer, 5,5'-dibromo BAPTA, and the SERCA-pump inhibitor, thapsigargin, resulted in a significant disruption of the E-YSL Ca(2+) waves, whereas exposure to the RyR antagonists, ryanodine and dantrolene, had no significant effect. These findings led us to propose that the E-YSL Ca(2+) waves are generated mainly via Ca(2+) release from IP(3)Rs located in the perinuclear ER, and that the clustering of the YSN is an essential step in providing a CICR pathway required for wave propagation.

Understanding this process is limited by the lack of systematic characterization of epithelial organisation. Here we apply network theory at the scale of individual cells to uncover patterns in cell-to-cell contacts that govern epithelial organisation. We provide an objective characterisation of epithelia using network representation, where cells are nodes and cell contacts are links. The features of individual cells, together with attributes of the cellular network, produce a defining signature that distinguishes epithelia from different organs, species, developmental stages and genetic conditions. The approach permits characterization, quantification and classification of normal and perturbed epithelia, and establishes a framework for understanding molecular mechanisms that underpin the architecture of complex tissues.},

abstract = {Complex mathematical and computational models are used in all areas of society and technology and yet model based science is increasingly contested or refuted, especially when models are applied to controversial themes in domains such as health, the environment or the economy. More stringent standards of proofs are demanded from model-based numbers, especially when these numbers represent potential financial losses, threats to human health or the state of the environment. Quantitative sensitivity analysis is generally agreed to be one such standard. Mathematical models are good at mapping assumptions into inferences. A modeller makes assumptions about laws pertaining to the system, about its status and a plethora of other, often arcane, system variables and internal model settings. To what extent can we rely on the model-based inference when most of these assumptions are fraught with uncertainties? Global Sensitivity Analysis offers an accessible treatment of such problems via quantitative sensitivity analysis, beginning with the first principles and guiding the reader through the full range of recommended practices with a rich set of solved exercises. The text explains the motivation for sensitivity analysis, reviews the required statistical concepts, and provides a guide to potential applications. The book: Provides a self-contained treatment of the subject, allowing readers to learn and practice global sensitivity analysis without further materials. Presents ways to frame the analysis, interpret its results, and avoid potential pitfalls. Features numerous exercises and solved problems to help illustrate the applications. Is authored by leading sensitivity analysis practitioners, combining a range of disciplinary backgrounds. Postgraduate students and practitioners in a wide range of subjects, including statistics, mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, environmental sciences, biology, toxicology, actuarial sciences, and econometrics will find much of use here. This book will prove equally valuable to engineers working on risk analysis and to financial analysts concerned with pricing and hedging.},

Seminal embryological experiments established the importance of induction, or cell interactions, in the formation of embryonic tissues and provided a foundation for molecular studies. In recent years, secreted gene products capable of inducing or patterning embryonic tissues have been identified. Despite these advances, embryologists remain challenged by fundamental questions: What are the endogenous inducing molecules? How is the action of an inducer spatially and temporally restricted? How does a limited group of inducers give rise to diversity of tissues? In this review, the focus is on the induction and patterning of mesodermal and neural tissues in the frog Xenopus laevis, with an emphasis on families of secreted molecules that appear to underlie inductive events throughout vertebrate embryogenesis.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the origins of the Spemann-Mangold organizer concept of 1924 in relation to his earlier background and concepts. It traces the consequences and fate of the organizer, and related concepts (embryonic induction, gradients, fields) through subsequent phases in the evolution of developmental biology up to the present, primarily from a UK perspective, but also in the USA. The origins of Wolpert's concept of positional information of around 1970 are analysed; this markedly different model of embryogenesis effectively took the place of the organizer, following on from a generally assumed out-datedness of the corpus of Spemann's data and concepts. Explanations in terms of historical forces are suggested; events are seen as a historical causal chain. A crucial factor appears to have been the long-term neglect of morphogenetic cell movement as an integral component of an adequate induction-based model. The paper discusses the general inter-relation of history and science, and particularly the implications for current scientific practice, including the potential for conceptual distortions due to historical factors. It is argued that historical considerations need to be included as part of the use and critical assessment of basic concepts in science.},

abstract = {The motions observed during avian gastrulation may be simply interpreted in terms of elasto-plastic flow of sheets. Such a model allows one to calculate the flow map inside the blastodisc, hence the evolution of its shape. In addition, the model predicts that there exists a region of high stress oriented radially from the caudal pole towards the center of the blastodisc, with a tensile component oriented orthoradially. If the stress generated by cellular motion is enough to provoke a crack in the extra cellular matrix, then mesoderm ingression proceeds through a "streak" (the primitive streak) oriented from the caudal pole inwards, which relieves the stress while it creates the three germ layers. The model predicts that crack opening is next followed by crack retreat (primitive streak retreat), as mesoderm ingression continues. As mesoderm ingression proceeds around the area pellucida, similar phenomena in the anterior pole may contribute to formation of the embryo. This gives a mechanical description of avian gastrulation which complements the biochemical approach. In addition, the model provides a simple explanation to the shape of the embryo at very early stages, and possibly an explanation of the entry point of the vitteline arteries into the mesoderm.},

We report the characterization and functional properties of admp in zebrafish. admp expression profile is consistent with a role in the organizer, including the tail organizer. We studied admp function through overexpression experiments, with the use of a dominant-negative form (TR-ADMP) and of an antisense morpholino-modified oligonucleotide. Our results indicate that the ADMP pathway causes the restriction of anterior and axial fates and that ADMP, BMP2b, and BMP7 pathways have distinct actions but cooperate in establishing proper dorso-ventral regionalization. This is shown by partial rescue of the dorsalized mutant snailhouse and of the ventralized mutant chordino, upon admp and tr-admp RNA injection, respectively. Moreover, ADMP and BMP7 probably form heterodimers as shown by the ability of TR-ADMP and BMP7 to antagonize each other. We observed that a MYC-tagged ADMP was secreted and detected in the extracellular space, suggesting that admp could act at a distance. Simultaneous local inhibition of bmp function at the blastoderm margin and impairment of ADMP secretion led to the induction of secondary head structures, confirming that the two pathways cooperatively regulate organizer formation and activity.},

abstract = {The dorsal marginal zone of the zebrafish blastula, equivalent to the amphibian Spemann organizer, is destined to become the tissues of the notochord and prechordal plate. Preceding gastrulation in the zebrafish, we find that these future mesendodermal cells acquire a cohesive cell behavior characterized by flattening and maximization of intercellular contacts, somewhat resembling cell compaction in mouse blastocysts. This behavior may suppress cell intermingling. Surprisingly, this blastula cell compaction requires normal function of spadetail, a gene known to be necessary for the dorsal convergent cell movement of paraxial mesoderm later in the gastrula. We propose that spadetail-dependent cell compaction subtly controls the early mixing and dispersal of dorsal cells that coalesce into the prospective organizer region. This early process may be necessary for the correct location of the boundary separating axial and paraxial cells.},

abstract = {During vertebrate gastrulation, convergence and extension cell movements are coordinated with the anteroposterior and mediolateral embryonic axes. Wnt planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP) signaling polarizes the motile behaviors of cells with respect to the anteroposterior embryonic axis. Understanding how Wnt/PCP signaling mediates convergence and extension (C{\&}E) movements requires analysis of the mechanisms employed to alter cell morphology and behavior with respect to embryonic polarity. Here, we examine the interactions between the microtubule cytoskeleton and Wnt/PCP signaling during zebrafish gastrulation. First, we assessed the location of the centrosome/microtubule organizing center (MTOC) relative to the cell nucleus and the body axes, as a marker of cell polarity. The intracellular position of MTOCs was polarized, perpendicular to the plane of the germ layers, independently of Wnt/PCP signaling. In addition, this position became biased posteriorly and medially within the plane of the germ layers at the transition from mid- to late gastrulation and from slow to fast C{\&}E movements. This depends on intact Wnt/PCP signaling through Knypek (Glypican4/6) and Dishevelled components. Second, we tested whether microtubules are required for planar cell polarization. Once the planar cell polarity is established, microtubules are not required for accumulation of Prickle at the anterior cell edge. However, microtubules are needed for cell-cell contacts and initiation of its anterior localization. Reciprocal interactions occur between Wnt/PCP signaling and microtubule cytoskeleton during C{\&}E gastrulation movements. Wnt/PCP signaling influences the polarity of the microtubule cytoskeleton and, conversely, microtubules are required for the asymmetric distribution of Wnt/PCP pathway components.},

abstract = {During vertebrate gastrulation, the three germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm are formed, and the resulting progenitor cells are brought into the positions from which they will later contribute more complex tissues and organs. A core element in this process is the internalization of mesodermal and endodermal progenitors at the onset of gastrulation. Although many of the molecules that induce mesendoderm have been identified, much less is known about the cellular mechanisms underlying mesendodermal cell internalization and germ layer formation. Here we show that at the onset of zebrafish gastrulation, mesendodermal progenitors in dorsal/axial regions of the germ ring internalize by single cell delamination. Once internalized, mesendodermal progenitors upregulate E-Cadherin (Cadherin 1) expression, become increasingly motile and eventually migrate along the overlying epiblast (ectodermal) cell layer towards the animal pole of the gastrula. When E-Cadherin function is compromised, mesendodermal progenitors still internalize, but, with gastrulation proceeding, fail to elongate and efficiently migrate along the epiblast, whereas epiblast cells themselves exhibit reduced radial cell intercalation movements. This indicates that cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is needed within the forming shield for both epiblast cell intercalation, and mesendodermal progenitor cell elongation and migration during zebrafish gastrulation. Our data provide insight into the cellular mechanisms underlying mesendodermal progenitor cell internalization and subsequent migration during zebrafish gastrulation, and the role of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in these processes.},

abstract = {Tissues of the dorsal midline of vertebrate embryos, such as notochord and floor plate, have been implicated in inductive interactions that pattern the neural tube and somites. In our screen for embryonic visible mutations in the zebrafish we found 113 mutations in more than 27 genes with altered body shape, often with additional defects in CNS development. We concentrated on a subgroup of mutations in ten genes (the midline-group) that cause defective development of the floor plate. By using floor plate markers, such as the signaling molecule sonic hedgehog, we show that the schmalspur (sur) gene is needed for early floor plate development, similar to one-eyed-pinhead (oep) and the previously described cyclops (cyc) gene. In contrast to oep and cyc, sur embryos show deletions of ventral CNS tissue restricted to the mid- and hindbrain, whereas the forebrain appears largely unaffected. In the underlying mesendodermal tissue of the head, sur is needed only for development of the posterior prechordal plate, whereas oep and cyc are required for both anterior and posterior prechordal plate development. Our analysis of sur mutants suggests that defects within the posterior prechordal plate may cause aberrant development of ventral CNS structures in the mid- and hindbrain. Later development of the floor plate is affected in mutant chameleon, you-too, sonic-you, iguana, detour, schmalhans and monorail embryos; these mutants often show additional defects in tissues that are known to depend on signals from notochord and floor plate. For example, sur, con and yot mutants show reduction of motor neurons; median deletions of brain tissue are seen in sur, con and yot embryos; and cyc, con, yot, igu and dtr mutants often show no or abnormal formation of the optic chiasm. We also find fusions of the ventral neurocranium for all midline mutants tested, which may reveal a hitherto unrecognized function of the midline in influencing differentiation of neural crest cells at their destination. As a working hypothesis, we propose that midline-group genes may act to maintain proper structure and inductive function of zebrafish midline tissues.},

abstract = {Vertebrate eye development in the anterior region of the neural plate involves a series of inductive interactions dependent on the underlying prechordal plate and signals from the midline of the neural plate, including Hedgehog. The mechanisms controlling the spatiotemporal expression pattern of hedgehog genes are currently not understood. Cyclopia is observed in trilobite (tri) and knypek (kny) mutants with affected convergent extension of the embryonic axis during gastrulation. Here, we demonstrate that tri mutants show a high frequency of partial or complete cyclopia, kny mutants exhibit cyclopia infrequently, while knym119 trim209 double-mutant embryos have dramatically reduced convergent extension and are completely cyclopic. We analyzed the relationships between the convergent extension defect, the expression of hedgehog and prechordal plate genes, and the formation of cyclopia in knym119 and trim209 mutants. Our results correlate the cyclopia phenotype with the abnormal location of hh-expressing cells with respect to the optic primordium. We show that cyclopia in these mutants is not due to an incompetence of tri and kny cells to respond to Hedgehog signaling. Rather, it is a consequence of exceeding a critical distance (>40-50 micrometer) between hedgehog-expressing cells and the prospective eye field. We hypothesize that at this distance, midline cells are not in an appropriate position to physically separate the eye field and that HH and other signals do not reach the appropriate target cells. Furthermore, tri and kny have overlapping functions in establishing proper alignment of the anterior neural plate and midline cells expressing shh and twhh genes when the partitioning of the eye primordium takes place.},

An evolutionarily conserved planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling system employs intra- and intercellular feedback interactions between its core components, including Frizzled, Van Gogh, Flamingo, Prickle, and Dishevelled, to establish their characteristic asymmetric intracellular distributions and coordinate planar polarity of cell populations. By translating global patterning information into asymmetries of cell membranes and intracellular organelles, PCP signaling coordinates morphogenetic behaviors of individual cells and cell populations with the embryonic polarity. In vertebrates, by polarizing cilia in the node/Kupffer's vesicle, PCP signaling links the anteroposterior to left-right embryonic polarity.},

In dns mutants, cells of the prechordal plate, such as the prospective hatching gland cells, fail to specify. Two genes are required for convergence and extension movements. In mutant trilobite embryos, extension movements on the dorsal side of the embryo are affected, whereas in the formerly described spadetail mutants, for which two new alleles have been isolated, convergent movements of ventrolateral cells to the dorsal side are blocked. Two genes are required for the development of the posterior end of the body axis. In pipetail mutants, the tailbud fails to move ventrally on the yolk sac after germ ring closure, and the tip of the tail fails to detach from the yolk tube. Mutants in kugelig (kgg) do not form the yolk tube at the posterior side of the yolk sac.},

Our analysis of global cell division patterns reveals a maternally defined initial morphodynamic symmetry break, which identifies the embryonic body axis.

abstract = {One of the major challenges of developmental biology is understanding the inductive and morphogenetic processes that shape the vertebrate embryo. In a large-scale genetic screen for zygotic effect, embryonic lethal mutations in zebrafish we have identified 25 mutations that affect specification of cell fates and/or cellular rearrangements during gastrulation. These mutations define at least 14 complementation groups, four of which correspond to previously identified genes. Phenotypic analysis of the ten novel loci revealed three groups of mutations causing distinct effects on cell fates in the gastrula. One group comprises mutations that lead to deficiencies in dorsal mesodermal fates and affect central nervous system patterning. Mutations from the second group affect formation of ventroposterior embryonic structures. We suggest that mutations in these two groups identify genes necessary for the formation, maintenance or function of the dorsal organizer and the ventral signaling pathway, respectively. Mutations in the third group affect primarily cellular rearrangements during gastrulation and have complex effects on cell fates in the embryo. This group, and to some extent mutations from the first two groups, affect the major morphogenetic processes, epiboly, convergence and extension, and tail morphogenesis. These mutations provide an approach to understanding the genetic control of gastrulation in vertebrates.},

abstract = {During vertebrate gastrulation, highly coordinated cellular rearrangements lead to the formation of the three germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. In zebrafish, silberblick (slb)/wnt11 regulates normal gastrulation movements by activating a signalling pathway similar to the Frizzled-signalling pathway, which establishes epithelial planar cell polarity (PCP) in Drosophila. However, the cellular mechanisms by which slb/wnt11 functions during zebrafish gastrulation are still unclear. Using high-resolution two-photon confocal imaging followed by computer-assisted reconstruction and motion analysis, we have analysed the movement and morphology of individual cells in three dimensions during the course of gastrulation. We show that in slb-mutant embryos, hypoblast cells within the forming germ ring have slower, less directed migratory movements at the onset of gastrulation. These aberrant cell movements are accompanied by defects in the orientation of cellular processes along the individual movement directions of these cells. We conclude that slb/wnt11-mediated orientation of cellular processes plays a role in facilitating and stabilising movements of hypoblast cells in the germ ring, thereby pointing at a novel function of the slb/wnt11 signalling pathway for the regulation of migratory cell movements at early stages of gastrulation.},

abstract = {The zebrafish EGF-CFC gene one-eyed pinhead (oep) is required zygotically for the formation of the ventral neuroectoderm, endoderm, and prechordal plate. Here we report that embryos lacking both maternal and zygotic Oep activity are defective in germ layer formation, organizer development, and the positioning of the anterior-posterior axis. An identical phenotype is displayed by double mutants for the nodal-related genes squint and cyclops. Mutations in oep eliminate the response to Squint and Cyclops overexpression but are suppressed by expression of Activin and activated forms of the type I receptor ActRIB and Smad2. Expression of the murine EGF-CFC gene cripto rescues oep mutants. These results suggest a conserved role for EGF-CFC proteins as essential extracellular cofactors for Nodal signaling during vertebrate development.},

abstract = {At the midblastula transition in the zebrafish, three, and only three, spatially separate mitotic domains arise with distinctive cycle lengths and rhythms. As in Drosophila and at about the equivalent stage, the mitotic domains reflect the fate map, but they do so only very crudely: two are extraembryonic and the third forms the entire embryo. The domains appear not to subdivide during gastrulation, when the germ layers form and when cells probably commit to their eventual fates. The domains may signal specification of morphogenesis rather than cell fate, because, shortly after they appear, each assumes a different role during epiboly, the first morphogenetic movement of the embryo. During meroblastic cleavage, and continuing in the early blastula, zebrafish blastomeres divide rapidly and synchronously. At the time of the tenth cleavage, the beginning of the midblastula transition, the cell cycle lengthens, and, as in Xenopus and Drosophila, cycle length comes under nucleocytoplasmic control (D.A.K. and C.B.K., manuscript in preparation). This nucleocytoplasmic control seems to be maintained during cycle lengthening in the next 2 or 3 cycles, comprising a midblastula transition period. We now show that functionally distinct subsets of cells that arise during this period have reproducibly different mitotic cycle lengths.},

abstract = {Aspects of the early lineages of blastomeres in the embryo of the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio have been described. Because of the optical clarity of the embryo, lineages of selected cells can be followed directly by microscopy through many cell divisions. Also, it is shown here that the fluorescent molecules fluorescein-dextran and rhodamine-horseradish peroxidase can be used as cell lineage tracers, marking the clonal progeny of founding blastomeres. The labeled cells can be easily visualized in the live embryo, and utilizing a sensitive video camera to amplify fluorescence, the same clone may be examined repeatedly while the cells divide and migrate. Cells that descend from a single blastomere remain closely associated together through the end of the blastula stage. At the time when epiboly begins (early gastrula) cells in the labeled clone scatter and become dispersed among unlabeled cells. It has been observed that there is no invariant mapping of the embryo's midline (determined by the position of the embryonic shield in the gastrula) with respect to the early planes of cleavage. This finding shows that in the zebrafish the region of the embryo that a cell will occupy is not specified by the cell's early ancestory.},

abstract = {Dye coupling and cell lineages of blastomeres that participate in the formation of the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) in the zebrafish Brachydanio rerio have been examined. The YSL is a multinucleate layer of nonyolky cytoplasm underlying the cellular blastoderm at one pole of the giant yolk cell. It forms at the time of the 10th (sometimes 9th) cleavage by a collapse of a set of blastomeres, termed marginal blastomeres, into the yolk cell. Marginal blastomeres possess cytoplasmic bridges to the yolk cell before the YSL forms, and injections of fluorescein-dextran into the cells revealed that bridges between the yolk cell and blastoderm do not persist after this time. Injections of Lucifer yellow revealed that shortly after the YSL forms the yolk cell and blastoderm are dye coupled, presumably by gap junctions, and that this coupling disappears gradually during early gastrulation. Lineage analyses revealed that not all of the progeny of early marginal blastomeres participate in YSL formation. Although some descendants of marginal blastomeres remained on the margin during successive cleavages, neither "compartment" nor "strict lineage" models are sufficient to explain the origin of the YSL. It is proposed that the position of a cell on the blastoderm margin, and not the cell's lineage, determines YSL cell fate.},

The cell division pattern is often very regular; in many embryos a blastomere's lineage may be ascertained from its position in the cluster through the 64-cell stage. At the 5th cleavage, however, significant variability in pattern is observed, and alternative patterns of the 5th cleavage are described. The early cleavages are partial, incompletely separating blastomeres from the giant yolk cell. The tracer fluorescein-dextran (FD) was injected into blastomeres to learn the extent of the cytoplasmic bridging. It was observed that until the 10th cleavage, blastomeres located along the blastoderm margin maintain cytoplasmic bridges to the yolk cell. Beginning with the 5th cleavage, FD injected into a nonmarginal blastomere either remains confined to the injected cell, or if the injection was early in the cell cycle, the tracer spreads to the cell's sibling, through a bridge persisting from the previous cleavage. On the other hand, injected Lucifer yellow spreads, presumably via gap junctions, widely among blastomeres in a pattern unrelated to lineage.},

abstract = {By exploiting the cell-cycle-dependent proteolysis of two ubiquitination oscillators, human Cdt1 and geminin, which are the direct substrates of SCF(Skp2) and APC(Cdh1) complexes, respectively, Fucci technique labels mammalian cell nuclei in G(1) and S/G(2)/M phases with different colors. Transgenic mice expressing these G(1) and S/G(2)/M markers offer a powerful means to investigate the coordination of the cell cycle with morphogenetic processes. We attempted to introduce these markers into zebrafish embryos to take advantage of their favorable optical properties. However, although the fundamental mechanisms for cell-cycle control appear to be well conserved among species, the G(1) marker based on the SCF(Skp2)-mediated degradation of human Cdt1 did not work in fish cells, probably because the marker was not ubiquitinated properly by a fish E3 ligase complex. We describe here the generation of a Fucci derivative using zebrafish homologs of Cdt1 and geminin, which provides sweeping views of cell proliferation in whole fish embryos. Remarkably, we discovered two anterior-to-posterior waves of cell-cycle transitions, G(1)/S and M/G(1), in the differentiating notochord. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of using the Cul4(Ddb1)-mediated Cdt1 degradation pathway common to all metazoans for the development of a G(1) marker that works in the nonmammalian animal model.},

abstract = {An epidermis surrounds all vertebrates, forming a water barrier between the external environment and the internal space of the organism. In the zebrafish, the embryonic epidermis consists of an outer enveloping layer (EVL) and an inner basal layer that have distinct embryonic origins. Differentiation of the EVL requires the maternal effect gene poky/ikk1 in EVL cells prior to establishment of the basal layer. This requirement is transient and maternal Ikk1 is sufficient to allow establishment of the EVL and formation of normal skin in adults. Similar to the requirement for Ikk1 in mouse epidermis, EVL cells in poky mutants fail to exit the cell cycle or express specific markers of differentiation. In spite of the similarity in phenotype, the molecular requirement for Ikk1 is different between mouse and zebrafish. Unlike the mouse, EVL differentiation requires functioning Poky/Ikk1 kinase activity but does not require the HLH domain. Previous work suggested that the EVL was a transient embryonic structure, and that maturation of the epidermis required replacement of the EVL with cells from the basal layer. We show here that the EVL is not lost during embryogenesis but persists to larval stages. Our results show that while the requirement for poky/ikk1 is conserved, the differences in molecular activity indicate that diversification of an epithelial differentiation program has allowed at least two developmental modes of establishing a multilayered epidermis in vertebrates.},

abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved mechanism in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) guide the degradation of cognate RNAs, but also promote heterochromatin assembly at repetitive DNA elements such as centromeric repeats. However, the full extent of RNAi functions and its endogenous targets have not been explored. Here we show that, in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, RNAi and heterochromatin factors cooperate to silence diverse loci, including sexual differentiation genes, genes encoding transmembrane proteins, and retrotransposons that are also targeted by the exosome RNA degradation machinery. In the absence of the exosome, transcripts are processed preferentially by the RNAi machinery, revealing siRNA clusters and a corresponding increase in heterochromatin modifications across large domains containing genes and retrotransposons. We show that the generation of siRNAs and heterochromatin assembly by RNAi is triggered by a mechanism involving the canonical poly(A) polymerase Pla1 and an associated RNA surveillance factor Red1, which also activate the exosome. Notably, siRNA production and heterochromatin modifications at these target loci are regulated by environmental growth conditions, and by developmental signals that induce gene expression during sexual differentiation. Our analyses uncover an interaction between RNAi and the exosome that is conserved in Drosophila, and show that differentiation signals modulate RNAi silencing to regulate developmental genes.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that some biological processes are equivalent to computation, but quantitative evidence for that view is weak. Plants must solve the problem of adjusting stomatal apertures to allow sufficient CO(2) uptake for photosynthesis while preventing excessive water loss. Under some conditions, stomatal apertures become synchronized into patches that exhibit richly complicated dynamics, similar to behaviors found in cellular automata that perform computational tasks. Using sequences of chlorophyll fluorescence images from leaves of Xanthium strumarium L. (cocklebur), we quantified spatial and temporal correlations in stomatal dynamics. Our values are statistically indistinguishable from those of the same correlations found in the dynamics of automata that compute. These results are consistent with the proposition that a plant solves its optimal gas exchange problem through an emergent, distributed computation performed by its leaves.},

In many situations, the human visual system fills in missing gaps in edges and boundaries, building and completing information that is not present. This presents a considerable challenge in computer vision, since most algorithms attempt to exploit existing data. Completion models, which postulate how to construct missing data, are popular but are often trained and specific to particular images. In this paper, we take the following perspective: We consider a reference point within an image as given and then develop an algorithm that tries to build missing information on the basis of the given point of view and the available information as boundary data to the algorithm. We test the algorithm on some standard images, including the classical triangle of Kanizsa and low signal/noise ratio medical images.},

abstract = {Epidermal hyperproliferation and inflammation are hallmarks of the human condition psoriasis. Here, we report that a zebrafish line with a mutation in the cargo adaptor protein Clint1 exhibits psoriasis-like phenotypes including epithelial hyperproliferation and leukocyte infiltration. Clint1 is an ENTH domain-containing protein that binds SNARE proteins and functions in vesicle trafficking; however, its in vivo function in animal models has not been reported to date. The clint1 mutants exhibit chronic inflammation characterized by increased Interleukin 1beta expression, leukocyte infiltration, bidirectional trafficking and phagocytosis of cellular debris. The defects in clint1 mutants can be rescued by expression of zebrafish clint1 and can be phenocopied with clint1-specific morpholinos, supporting an essential role for Clint1 in epidermal development. Interaction studies suggest that Clint1 and Lethal giant larvae 2 function synergistically to regulate epidermal homeostasis. Accordingly, clint1 mutants show impaired hemidesmosome formation, loss of cell-cell contacts and increased motility suggestive of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Taken together, our findings describe a novel function for the ENTH domain protein Clint1 in epidermal development and inflammation and suggest that its deficiency in zebrafish generates a phenotype that resembles the human condition psoriasis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The desmosomal cadherins (DCs), desmocollin (Dsc) and desmoglein (Dsg), are the adhesion molecules of desmosomes, intercellular adhesive junctions of epithelia and cardiac muscle. Both the DCs and desmosomes have demonstrably essential roles in mammalian development. In order to initiate their study in a more tractable developmental system we have characterised zebrafish DCs and examined their roles in early zebrafish development.

RESULTS:We find that zebrafish possess one Dsc, the orthologue of mammalian Dsc1, which we designate zfDsc. Unlike mammalian Dscs, zfDsc exists only as the "a" form since it lacks the alternatively-spliced mini-exon that shortens the cytoplasmic domain to produce the "b" form. Zebrafish possess two Dsgs, designated zfDsgα and zfDsgβ, orthologues of mammalian Dsg2. They show 43.8% amino acid identity and the α form has a 43 amino acid glycine-rich sequence of unknown function in its extracellular domain. Both zfDsc and zfDsgα were present as maternal and zygotic transcripts whereas zfDsgβ was first expressed from 8 hours post-fertilisation (hpf). All three transcripts were present throughout subsequent stages of development. Morpholino knockdown of both zfDsc and zfDsgα expression produced similar defects in epiboly, axis elongation and somite formation, associated with abnormal desmosomes or reduced desmosome numbers.

CONCLUSIONS:These results demonstrate an important role for DCs and desmosomes in the early morphogenesis of the zebrafish embryo, provide a basis for more detailed analysis of their role and raise interesting questions relating to the evolution and functional significance of DC isoforms.},
