journal = {J Cell Biol},
title = {CDC42 and Rac1 control different actin-dependent processes in the Drosophila wing disc epithelium},
abstract = {Cdc42 and Rac1 are members of the rho family of small guanosinetriphosphatases and are required for a diverse set of cytoskeleton-membrane interactions in different cell types. Here we show that these two proteins contribute differently to the organization of epithelial cells in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. Drac1 is required to assemble actin at adherens junctions. Failure of adherens junction actin assembly in Drac1 dominant-negative mutants is associated with increased cell death. Dcdc42, on the other hand, is required for processes that involve polarized cell shape changes during both pupal and larval development. In the third larval instar, Dcdc42 is required for apico-basal epithelial elongation. Whereas normal wing disc epithelial cells increase in height more than twofold during the third instar, cells that express a dominant-negative version of Dcdc42 remain short and are abnormally shaped. Dcdc42 localizes to both apical and basal regions of the cell during these events, and mediates elongation, at least in part, by effecting a reorganization of the basal actin cytoskeleton. These observations suggest that a common cdc42-based mechanism may govern polarized cell shape changes in a wide variety of cell types.},

abstract = {A new cell-level finite element formulation is presented and used to investigate how epithelia and other planar collections of viscous cells might deform during events such as embryo morphogenesis and wound healing. Forces arising from cytoskeletal components, cytoplasm viscosity, and cell-cell adhesions are included. Individual cells are modeled using multiple finite elements, and cell rearrangements can occur. Simulations of cell-sheet stretching indicate that the initial stages of sheet stretching are characterized by changes in cell shape, while subsequent stages are governed by cell rearrangement. Inferences can be made from the simulations about the forces that act in real cell sheets when suitable experimental data are available.},

title = {Quantitative modeling in cell biology: what is it good for?},
abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge in the number of pioneering studies combining experiments with quantitative modeling to explain both relatively simple modules of molecular machinery of the cell and to achieve system-level understanding of cellular networks. Here we discuss the utility and methods of modeling and review several current models of cell signaling, cytoskeletal self-organization, nuclear transport, and the cell cycle. We discuss successes of and barriers to modeling in cell biology and its future directions, and we argue, using the field of bacterial chemotaxis as an example, that the closer the complete systematic understanding of cell behavior is, the more important modeling becomes and the more experiment and theory merge.},

title = {The mechanisms underlying primitive streak formation in the chick embryo},
abstract = {Formation of the primitive streak is one of the key events in the early development of amniote embryos. The streak is the site where during gastrulation the mesendoderm cells ingress to take up their correct topographical positions in the embryo. The process of streak formation can be conveniently observed in the chick embryo, where the streak forms as an accumulation of cells in the epiblast in the posterior pole of the embryo and extends subsequently in anterior direction until it covers 80% of the epiblast. A prerequisite for streak formation is the differentiation of mesoderm, which is induced in the epiblast at the interface between the posterior Area Opaca and Area Pellucida in a sickle shaped domain overlying Koller's sickle. Current views on the molecular mechanisms of mesoderm induction by inducing signals from the Area Opaca and inhibitory signals from the hypoblast are briefly discussed. During streak formation the sickle of mesoderm cells transforms into an elongated structure in the central midline of the embryo. We discuss possible cellular mechanisms underlying this process, such as oriented cell division, cell-cell intercalation, chemotactic cell movement in response to attractive and repulsive signals and a combination of chemotaxis and contact following. We review current experimental evidence in favor and against these different hypotheses and outline some the outstanding questions. Since many of the interactions between cells signaling and moving are dynamic and nonlinear in nature they will require detailed modeling and computer simulations to be understood in detail.},

abstract = {Embryonic development involves global changes in tissue shape and architecture that are driven by cell shape changes and rearrangements within cohesive cell sheets. Morphogenetic changes at the cell and tissue level require that cells generate forces and that these forces are transmitted between the cells of a coherent tissue. Contractile forces generated by the actin-myosin cytoskeleton are critical for morphogenesis, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of contraction have been elusive for many cell shape changes and movements. Recent studies that have combined live imaging with computational and biophysical approaches have provided new insights into how contractile forces are generated and coordinated between cells and tissues. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the mechanical forces that shape cells, tissues, and embryos, emphasizing the different modes of actomyosin contraction that generate various temporal and spatial patterns of force generation.},

title = {Delayed coupling theory of vertebrate segmentation},
abstract = {Rhythmic and sequential subdivision of the elongating vertebrate embryonic body axis into morphological somites is controlled by an oscillating multicellular genetic network termed the segmentation clock. This clock operates in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), generating dynamic stripe patterns of oscillatory gene-expression across the field of PSM cells. How these spatial patterns, the clock's collective period, and the underlying cellular-level interactions are related is not understood. A theory encompassing temporal and spatial domains of local and collective aspects of the system is essential to tackle these questions. Our delayed coupling theory achieves this by representing the PSM as an array of phase oscillators, combining four key elements: a frequency profile of oscillators slowing across the PSM; coupling between neighboring oscillators; delay in coupling; and a moving boundary describing embryonic axis elongation. This theory predicts that the segmentation clock's collective period depends on delayed coupling. We derive an expression for pattern wavelength across the PSM and show how this can be used to fit dynamic wildtype gene-expression patterns, revealing the quantitative values of parameters controlling spatial and temporal organization of the oscillators in the system. Our theory can be used to analyze experimental perturbations, thereby identifying roles of genes involved in segmentation.},

abstract = {We present a phenomenological modeling framework for development. Our purpose is to provide a systematic method for discovering and expressing correlations in experimental data on gene expression and other developmental processes. The modeling framework is based on a connectionist or "neural net" dynamics for biochemical regulators, coupled to "grammatical rules" which describe certain features of the birth, growth, and death of cells, synapses and other biological entities. We outline how spatial geometry can be included, although this part of the model is not complete. As an example of the application of our results to a specific biological system, we show in detail how to derive a rigorously testable model of the network of segmentation genes operating in the blastoderm of Drosophila. To further illustrate our methods, we sketch how they could be applied to two other important developmental processes: cell cycle control and cell-cell induction. We also present a simple biochemical model leading to our assumed connectionist dynamics which shows that the dynamics used is at least compatible with known chemical mechanisms.},

abstract = {Complex transcriptional behaviours are encoded in the DNA sequences of gene regulatory regions. Advances in our understanding of these behaviours have been recently gained through quantitative models that describe how molecules such as transcription factors and nucleosomes interact with genomic sequences. An emerging view is that every regulatory sequence is associated with a unique binding affinity landscape for each molecule and, consequently, with a unique set of molecule-binding configurations and transcriptional outputs. We present a quantitative framework based on existing methods that unifies these ideas. This framework explains many experimental observations regarding the binding patterns of factors and nucleosomes and the dynamics of transcriptional activation. It can also be used to model more complex phenomena such as transcriptional noise and the evolution of transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {To date, the role of transport and insertion of membrane in the control of membrane remodelling during cell and tissue morphogenesis has received little attention. In contrast, the contributions of cytoskeletal rearrangements and both intercellular and cell-substrate attachments have been the focus of many studies. Here, we review work from many developmental systems that highlights the importance of polarized membrane growth and suggests a general model for the role of endocytic recycling during cell morphogenesis. We also address how the spatio-temporal control of membrane insertion during development can account for various classes of tissue rearrangements. We suggest that tubulogenesis, tissue spreading and cell intercalation stem mostly from a remarkably small number of cell intrinsic surface remodelling events that confer on cells different modes of migratory behaviours.},

title = {Quantitative differences in tissue surface tension influence zebrafish germ layer positioning},
abstract = {This study provides direct functional evidence that differential adhesion, measurable as quantitative differences in tissue surface tension, influences spatial positioning between zebrafish germ layer tissues. We show that embryonic ectodermal and mesendodermal tissues generated by mRNA-overexpression behave on long-time scales like immiscible fluids. When mixed in hanging drop culture, their cells segregate into discrete phases with ectoderm adopting an internal position relative to the mesendoderm. The position adopted directly correlates with differences in tissue surface tension. We also show that germ layer tissues from untreated embryos, when extirpated and placed in culture, adopt a configuration similar to those of their mRNA-overexpressing counterparts. Down-regulating E-cadherin expression in the ectoderm leads to reduced surface tension and results in phase reversal with E-cadherin-depleted ectoderm cells now adopting an external position relative to the mesendoderm. These results show that in vitro cell sorting of zebrafish mesendoderm and ectoderm tissues is specified by tissue interfacial tensions. We perform a mathematical analysis indicating that tissue interfacial tension between actively motile cells contributes to the spatial organization and dynamics of these zebrafish germ layers in vivo.},

Wide ranging cellular processes, often without parallels in conventional cell culture systems, work together to generate the architecture and modulate forces that produce and guide shape changes in the embryo. In this review we summarize the early development of the frog Xenopus laevis from a biomechanical perspective. We describe processes operating in the embryo from whole embryo scale, the tissue-scale, to the cellular and extracellular matrix scale. We focus on describing cells, their behaviors and the unique microenvironments they traverse during gastrulation and discuss the role of tissue mechanics in these processes.},

title = {Dishevelled controls cell polarity during Xenopus gastrulation},
abstract = {Although cell movements are vital for establishing the normal architecture of embryos, it is unclear how these movements are regulated during development in vertebrates. Inhibition of Xenopus Dishevelled (Xdsh) function disrupts convergent extension movements of cells during gastrulation, but the mechanism of this effect is unclear, as cell fates are not affected. In Drosophila, Dishevelled controls both cell fate and cell polarity, but whether Dishevelled is involved in controlling cell polarity in vertebrate embryos has not been investigated. Here we show, using time-lapse confocal microscopy, that the failure of cells lacking Xdsh function to undergo convergent extension results from defects in cell polarity. Furthermore, Xdsh mutations that inhibit convergent extension correspond to mutations in Drosophila Dishevelled that selectively perturb planar cell polarity. Finally, the localization of Xdsh at the membrane of normal dorsal mesodermal cells is consistent with Xdsh controlling cell polarity. Our results show that polarized cell behaviour is essential for convergent extension and is controlled by vertebrate Dishevelled. Thus, a vertebrate equivalent of the Drosophila planar cell polarity signalling cascade may be required for normal gastrulation.},

title = {Modeling cell rheology with the Subcellular Element Model},
abstract = {Recently, the Subcellular Element Model (SEM) has been introduced, primarily to compute the dynamics of large numbers of three-dimensional deformable cells in multicellular systems. Within this model framework, each cell is represented by a collection of elastically coupled elements, interacting with one another via short-range potentials, and dynamically updated using over-damped Langevin dynamics. The SEM can also be used to represent a single cell in more detail, by using a larger number of subcellular elements exclusively identified with that cell. We have tested whether, in this context, the SEM yields viscoelastic properties consistent with those measured on single living cells. Employing virtual methods of bulk rheology and microrheology we find that the SEM successfully captures many cellular rheological properties at intermediate time scales and moderate strains, including weak power law rheology. In its simplest guise, the SEM cannot describe long-time/large-strain cell responses. Capturing these cellular properties requires extensions of the SEM which incorporate active cytoskeletal rearrangement. Such extensions will be the subject of a future publication.},

title = {Predicting expression patterns from regulatory sequence in Drosophila segmentation},
abstract = {The establishment of complex expression patterns at precise times and locations is key to metazoan development, yet a mechanistic understanding of the underlying transcription control networks is still missing. Here we describe a novel thermodynamic model that computes expression patterns as a function of cis-regulatory sequence and of the binding-site preferences and expression of participating transcription factors. We apply this model to the segmentation gene network of Drosophila melanogaster and find that it predicts expression patterns of cis-regulatory modules with remarkable accuracy, demonstrating that positional information is encoded in the regulatory sequence and input factor distribution. Our analysis reveals that both strong and weaker binding sites contribute, leading to high occupancy of the module DNA, and conferring robustness against mutation; short-range homotypic clustering of weaker sites facilitates cooperative binding, which is necessary to sharpen the patterns. Our computational framework is generally applicable to most protein-DNA interaction systems.},

title = {Integrin alpha5beta1 and fibronectin regulate polarized cell protrusions required for Xenopus convergence and extension},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Integrin recognition of fibronectin is required for normal gastrulation including the mediolateral cell intercalation behaviors that drive convergent extension and the elongation of the frog dorsal axis; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved are unclear. RESULTS: We report that depletion of fibronectin with antisense morpholinos blocks both convergent extension and mediolateral protrusive behaviors in explant preparations. Both chronic depletion of fibronectin and acute disruptions of integrin alpha5beta1 binding to fibronectin increases the frequency and randomizes the orientation of polarized cellular protrusions, suggesting that integrin-fibronectin interactions normally repress frequent random protrusions in favor of fewer mediolaterally oriented ones. In the absence of integrin alpha5beta1 binding to fibronectin, convergence movements still occur but result in convergent thickening instead of convergent extension. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a role for integrin signaling in regulating the protrusive activity that drives axial extension. We hypothesize that the planar spatial arrangement of the fibrillar fibronectin matrix, which delineates tissue compartments within the embryo, is critical for promoting productive oriented protrusions in intercalating cells.},

Automatic cells classification provides the bases to measure the variability of relevant parameters, such as cells density, in different classes of cells and is finalized to the estimation of effectiveness and selectivity of anticancer drug in vivo. We aim at approaching these measurements through epithelial/deep cells classification, epithelial area and thickness measurement, and density estimation from scattered points. Our procedure is based on Minimal Surfaces, Otsu clustering, Delaunay Triangulation, and Within-R cloud of points density estimation approaches. In this paper, we investigated whether the distance between nuclei and epithelial surface is sufficient to discriminate epithelial cells from deep cells. Comparisons of different density estimators, experimental results, and extensively accuracy measurements are included.},

title = {Evo-Devo: evolutionary developmental mechanisms},
abstract = {Evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo) as a discipline is concerned, among other things, with discovering and understanding the role of changes in developmental mechanisms in the evolutionary origin of aspects of the phenotype. In a very real sense, Evo-Devo opens the black box between genotype and phenotype, or more properly, phenotypes as multiple life history stages arise in many organisms from a single genotype. Changes in the timing or positioning of an aspect of development in a descendant relative to an ancestor (heterochrony and heterotopy) were two evolutionary developmental mechanisms identified by Ernst Haeckel in the 1870s. Many more have since been identified, in large part because of our enhanced understanding of development and because new mechanisms emerge as development proceeds: the transfer from maternal to zygotic genomic control; cell-to-cell interactions; cell differentiation and cell migration; embryonic inductions; functional interactions at the tissue and organ levels; growth. Within these emergent processes, gene networks and gene cascades (genetic modules) link the genotype with morphogenetic units (cellular modules, namely germ layers, embryonic fields or cellular condensations), while epigenetic processes such as embryonic inductions, tissue interactions and functional integration, link morphogenetic units to the phenotype. Evolutionary developmental mechanisms also include interactions between individuals of the same species, individuals of different species, and species and their biotic and/or abiotic environment. Such interactions link ecological communities. Importantly, there is little to distinguish the causality that underlies these interactions from that which underlies inductive interactions within embryos.},

title = {A gene network approach to modeling early neurogenesis in Drosophila},
abstract = {We have produced a model of genetic regulation to simulate how neuroblasts and sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells differentiate from proneural clusters of equivalent cells. Parameters of the model (mainly gene interaction strengths) are optimized in order to fit schematic patterns of expression, drawn from the literature, of genes that are involved in this process of cell fate specification. The model provides suggestions about the role of lateral signalling in neurogenesis and yields specific and testable predictions about the timing and position of appearance of neuroblasts and SOPs within proneural clusters, and about the dynamics of gene expression in individual cells. Experimental testing of these predictions and fits to more accurate quantitative data will help determine which set of model parameters can best describe early neurogenesis.},

title = {Shield formation at the onset of zebrafish gastrulation},
abstract = {During vertebrate gastrulation, the three germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm are formed, and the resulting progenitor cells are brought into the positions from which they will later contribute more complex tissues and organs. A core element in this process is the internalization of mesodermal and endodermal progenitors at the onset of gastrulation. Although many of the molecules that induce mesendoderm have been identified, much less is known about the cellular mechanisms underlying mesendodermal cell internalization and germ layer formation. Here we show that at the onset of zebrafish gastrulation, mesendodermal progenitors in dorsal/axial regions of the germ ring internalize by single cell delamination. Once internalized, mesendodermal progenitors upregulate E-Cadherin (Cadherin 1) expression, become increasingly motile and eventually migrate along the overlying epiblast (ectodermal) cell layer towards the animal pole of the gastrula. When E-Cadherin function is compromised, mesendodermal progenitors still internalize, but, with gastrulation proceeding, fail to elongate and efficiently migrate along the epiblast, whereas epiblast cells themselves exhibit reduced radial cell intercalation movements. This indicates that cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is needed within the forming shield for both epiblast cell intercalation, and mesendodermal progenitor cell elongation and migration during zebrafish gastrulation. Our data provide insight into the cellular mechanisms underlying mesendodermal progenitor cell internalization and subsequent migration during zebrafish gastrulation, and the role of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in these processes.},

In particular, agent-based methods turn more and more important because of fast increasing computational power which makes even large systems accessible.

title = {Hydrodynamic simulation of multicellular embryo invagination},
abstract = {The mechanical aspects of embryonic morphogenesis have been widely analysed by numerical simulations of invagination in sea urchins and Drosophila gastrulation. Finite element models, which describe the tissue as a continuous medium, lead to the global invagination morphogenesis observed in vivo. Here we develop a simulation of multicellular embryo invagination that allows access to both cellular and multicellular mechanical behaviours of the embryo. In this model, the tissue is composed of adhesive individual cells, in which shape change dynamics is governed by internal acto-myosin forces and the hydrodynamic flow associated with membrane movements. We investigated the minimal structural and force elements sufficient to phenocopy mesoderm invagination. The minimal structures are cell membranes characterized by an acto-myosin cortical tension and connected by apical and basal junctions and an acto-myosin contractile ring connected to the apical junctions. An increase in the apical-cortical surface tension is the only control parameter change required to phenocopy most known multicellular and cellular shape changes of Drosophila gastrulation. Specifically, behaviours observed in vivo, including apical junction movements at the onset of gastrulation, cell elongation and subsequent shortening during invagination, and the development of a dorso-ventral gradient of thickness of the embryo, are predicted by this model as passive mechanical consequences of the genetically controlled increase in the apical surface tension in invaginating mesoderm cells, thus demonstrating the accurate description of structures at both global and single cell scales.},

title = {Diffusion and scaling during early embryonic pattern formation},
abstract = {Development of spatial patterns in multicellular organisms depends on gradients in the concentration of signaling molecules that control gene expression. In the Drosophila embryo, Bicoid (Bcd) morphogen controls cell fate along 70% of the anteroposterior axis but is translated from mRNA localized at the anterior pole. Gradients of Bcd and other morphogens are thought to arise through diffusion, but this basic assumption has never been rigorously tested in living embryos. Furthermore, because diffusion sets a relationship between length and time scales, it is hard to see how patterns of gene expression established by diffusion would scale proportionately as egg size changes during evolution. Here, we show that the motion of inert molecules through the embryo is well described by the diffusion equation on the relevant length and time scales, and that effective diffusion constants are essentially the same in closely related dipteran species with embryos of very different size. Nonetheless, patterns of gene expression in these different species scale with egg length. We show that this scaling can be traced back to scaling of the Bcd gradient itself. Our results, together with constraints imposed by the time scales of development, suggest that the mechanism for scaling is a species-specific adaptation of the Bcd lifetime.},

title = {Chromatin signature of embryonic pluripotency is established during genome activation},
abstract = {After fertilization the embryonic genome is inactive until transcription is initiated during the maternal-zygotic transition. This transition coincides with the formation of pluripotent cells, which in mammals can be used to generate embryonic stem cells. To study the changes in chromatin structure that accompany pluripotency and genome activation, we mapped the genomic locations of histone H3 molecules bearing lysine trimethylation modifications before and after the maternal-zygotic transition in zebrafish. Histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which is repressive, and H3K4me3, which is activating, were not detected before the transition. After genome activation, more than 80% of genes were marked by H3K4me3, including many inactive developmental regulatory genes that were also marked by H3K27me3. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the same promoter regions had both trimethylation marks. Such bivalent chromatin domains also exist in embryonic stem cells and are thought to poise genes for activation while keeping them repressed. Furthermore, we found many inactive genes that were uniquely marked by H3K4me3. Despite this activating modification, these monovalent genes were neither expressed nor stably bound by RNA polymerase II. Inspection of published data sets revealed similar monovalent domains in embryonic stem cells. Moreover, H3K4me3 marks could form in the absence of both sequence-specific transcriptional activators and stable association of RNA polymerase II, as indicated by the analysis of an inducible transgene. These results indicate that bivalent and monovalent domains might poise embryonic genes for activation and that the chromatin profile associated with pluripotency is established during the maternal-zygotic transition.},

title = {The planar polarity gene strabismus regulates convergent extension movements in Xenopus},
abstract = {The signaling mechanisms that specify, guide and coordinate cell behavior during embryonic morphogenesis are poorly understood. We report that a Xenopus homolog of the Drosophila planar cell polarity gene strabismus (stbm) participates in the regulation of convergent extension, a critical morphogenetic process required for the elongation of dorsal structures in vertebrate embryos. Overexpression of Xstbm, which is expressed broadly in early development and subsequently in the nervous system, causes severely shortened trunk structures; a similar phenotype results from inhibiting Xstbm translation using a morpholino antisense oligo. Experiments with Keller explants further demonstrate that Xstbm can regulate convergent extension in both dorsal mesoderm and neural tissue. The specification of dorsal tissues is not affected. The Xstbm phenotype resembles those obtained with several other molecules with roles in planar polarity signaling, including Dishevelled and Frizzled-7 and -8. Unlike these proteins, however, Stbm has little effect on conventional Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in either frog or fly assays. Thus our results strongly support the emerging hypothesis that a vertebrate analog of the planar polarity pathway governs convergent extension movements.},

abstract = {Living cells adapt to the stiffness of their environment. However, cell response to stiffness is mainly thought to be initiated by the deformation of adhesion complexes under applied force. In order to determine whether cell response was triggered by stiffness or force, we have developed a unique method allowing us to tune, in real time, the effective stiffness experienced by a single living cell in a uniaxial traction geometry. In these conditions, the rate of traction force buildup dF/dt was adapted to stiffness in less than 0.1 s. This integrated fast response was unambiguously triggered by stiffness, and not by force. It suggests that early cell response could be mechanical in nature. In fact, local force-dependent signaling through adhesion complexes could be triggered and coordinated by the instantaneous cell-scale adaptation of dF/dt to stiffness. Remarkably, the effective stiffness method presented here can be implemented on any mechanical setup. Thus, beyond single-cell mechanosensing, this method should be useful to determine the role of rigidity in many fundamental phenomena such as morphogenesis and development.},

abstract = {The tissue polarity genes control the polarity of hairs, bristles and ommatidia in the adult epidermis of Drosophila. We report here the identification of a new tissue polarity gene named starry night (stan). Mutations in this essential gene alter the polarity of cuticular structures in all regions of the adult body. The detailed polarity phenotype of stan on the wing suggested that it is most likely a component of the frizzled (fz) pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, stan appears to be downstream of and required for fz function. We molecularly cloned stan and found that it encodes a huge protocadherin containing nine cadherin motifs, four EGF-like motifs, two laminin G motifs, and seven transmembrane domains. This suggests that Stan functions in signal reception, perhaps together with Fz.},

title = {Developmental toxicity of bifenthrin in embryo-larval stages of zebrafish},
abstract = {Bifenthrin (BF) is widely used as a miticide in orchards, nurseries and homes due to its great photostability and insecticidal activity. Recently, extensive research has been conducted on the toxicity of BF in in vitro and in vivo assays. However, no data is so far available regarding the developmental toxicity of BF to fish in early life stages. In this study, the developmental effects of BF were evaluated in embryo-larval zebrafish. At specified stages (24, 48, 72, and 96hpf), spontaneous movement, survival and hatching as well as non-lethal malformation like curved body axis or edema were described in detail. No significant lethal effects of the treatment group compared to the control occurred except for the highest concentration group exposed for 96h. The hatching process was accelerated by BF in a concentration-dependent way, correlated with increasing spontaneous movement. Developmental abnormalities were observed for the test compound with 96-h EC(50) of 256microgL(-1) for pericardial edema, and 109microgL(-1) for curved body axis. Results from locomotor assays showed that zebrafish larvae of 96hpf exhibited impaired swimming behaviour after exposure to 50, 100, and 200microgL(-1) from 3 to 84hpf. After being cultured in the BF-free embryo medium for one more day till 120hpf, larvae from the 50microgL(-1)group seemed to have recovered and showed no difference in the swimming behaviour compared to the control while animals of the two higher concentration groups were exhausted and swam in significantly lower speed. Furthermore, reverse transcription real-time PCR results showed that vitellogenin I expressions were significantly induced in larval zebrafish exposed to 150microgL(-1) BF for 72h, indicating the disruption of the endocrine level. In summary, our studies showed that BF was developmentally toxic to zebrafish in early life stage after short-term exposure to sublethal concentrations and had the ability to impair the individual behaviours which are of great importance in the assessment of their ecological fitness.},

title = {Microfluidics for bacterial chemotaxis},
abstract = {Microfluidics is revolutionizing the way we study the motile behavior of cells, by enabling observations at high spatial and temporal resolution in carefully controlled microenvironments. An important class of such behavior is bacterial chemotaxis, which plays a fundamental role in a broad range of processes, including disease pathogenesis, biofilm formation, bioremediation, and even carbon cycling in the ocean. In biophysical research, bacterial chemotaxis represents a powerful model system to understand how cells and organisms sense and respond to gradients. Using microfluidics to study chemotaxis of free-swimming bacteria presents experimental challenges that are distinct from those arising in chemotaxis studies of surface-adherent cells. Recently, these challenges have been met by the development of advanced microdevices, able to generate flow-free, steady gradients of arbitrary shape. Much attention to date has been focused on tool development. Yet, we are now at an exciting turning point where science begins to balance technology. Indeed, recent microfluidic studies provided new insights on both the mechanisms governing bacterial gradient sensing (e.g. tuning of response sensitivity, discrimination between conflicting gradients) and the large-scale consequences of chemotaxis (e.g. in the oceans). Here we outline the principles underlying recently proposed gradient generators for bacterial chemotaxis, illustrate the advantage of the microfluidic approach through selected examples, and identify a broader set of scientific questions that may now be addressed with this rapidly developing technology. The latest generation of microfluidic gradient generators, in particular, holds appeal for both biophysicists seeking to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of bacterial chemotaxis, and ecologists wishing to model chemotaxis in realistic environments. Time is ripe for a deeper integration between technology and biology in fully bringing to bear microfluidics on studies of this fascinating microbial behavior.},

title = {Modeling the influence of the E-cadherin-beta-catenin pathway in cancer cell invasion: a multiscale approach},
abstract = {In this article, we show, using a mathematical multiscale model, how cell adhesion may be regulated by interactions between E-cadherin and beta-catenin and how the control of cell adhesion may be related to cell migration, to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and to invasion in populations of eukaryotic cells. E-cadherin mediates cell-cell adhesion and plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of junctional contacts between cells. Loss of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion is a key feature of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. beta-catenin is an intracellular protein associated with the actin cytoskeleton of a cell. E-cadherins bind to beta-catenin to form a complex which can interact both with neighboring cells to form bonds, and with the cytoskeleton of the cell. When cells detach from one another, beta-catenin is released into the cytoplasm, targeted for degradation, and downregulated. In this process there are multiple protein-complexes involved which interact with beta-catenin and E-cadherin. Within a mathematical individual-based multiscale model, we are able to explain experimentally observed patterns solely by a variation of cell-cell adhesive interactions. Implications for cell migration and cancer invasion are also discussed.},

title = {An integrative computational model for intestinal tissue renewal},
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The luminal surface of the gut is lined with a monolayer of epithelial cells that acts as a nutrient absorptive engine and protective barrier. To maintain its integrity and functionality, the epithelium is renewed every few days. Theoretical models are powerful tools that can be used to test hypotheses concerning the regulation of this renewal process, to investigate how its dysfunction can lead to loss of homeostasis and neoplasia, and to identify potential therapeutic interventions. Here we propose a new multiscale model for crypt dynamics that links phenomena occurring at the subcellular, cellular and tissue levels of organisation. METHODS: At the subcellular level, deterministic models characterise molecular networks, such as cell-cycle control and Wnt signalling. The output of these models determines the behaviour of each epithelial cell in response to intra-, inter- and extracellular cues. The modular nature of the model enables us to easily modify individual assumptions and analyse their effects on the system as a whole. RESULTS: We perform virtual microdissection and labelling-index experiments, evaluate the impact of various model extensions, obtain new insight into clonal expansion in the crypt, and compare our predictions with recent mitochondrial DNA mutation data. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that relaxing the assumption that stem-cell positions are fixed enables clonal expansion and niche succession to occur. We also predict that the presence of extracellular factors near the base of the crypt alone suffices to explain the observed spatial variation in nuclear beta-catenin levels along the crypt axis.},

title = {Extracellular matrix fluctuations during early embryogenesis},
abstract = {Extracellular matrix (ECM) movements and rearrangements were studied in avian embryos during early stages of development. We show that the ECM moves as a composite material, whereby distinct molecular components as well as spatially separated layers exhibit similar displacements. Using scanning wide field and confocal microscopy we show that the velocity field of ECM displacement is smooth in space and that ECM movements are correlated even at locations separated by several hundred micrometers. Velocity vectors, however, strongly fluctuate in time. The autocorrelation time of the velocity fluctuations is less than a minute. Suppression of the fluctuations yields a persistent movement pattern that is shared among embryos at equivalent stages of development. The high resolution of the velocity fields allows a detailed spatio-temporal characterization of important morphogenetic processes, especially tissue dynamics surrounding the embryonic organizer (Hensen's node).},

title = {The midblastula transition, the YSL transition and the onset of gastrulation in Fundulus},
abstract = {The first signs of cell motility appear in Fundulus toward the end of cleavage, after cleavages 11 and 12. When blastomers cease cleaving, their surfaces undulate and form blebs. At first, these blebbing cell remain in place. Gradually thereafter they begin movement, with blebs and filolamellipodia serving as organs of locomotion. Non-motile cleaving blastomeres have thus differentiated into motile blastula cells. This transformation corresponds to the midblastula transition of amphibian embryos. Gastrulation in Fundulus begins with vegetalward contraction of the external yolk syncytial layer. This causes narrowing of the E-YSL and initiates the epibolic expansion of the blastoderm. Convergent movements of deep cells within the blastoderm begin toward the end of this contraction. The YSL forms as a result of invasion of the yolk cell cytoplasm by nuclei from open marginal blastomers during cleavage. These YSL nuclei then undergo five metachronous divisions. After this, they divide no more. YSL contraction begins approximately 1.5 hours after cessation of these divisions (21-22 degrees C). This cessation of nuclear divisions is preceded by a gradual decrease in rate. (1) The duration of each succeeding mitosis increases steadily and often some nuclei do not divide at mitosis V. (2) The duration of interphases between succeeding mitoses also increases, but to a much greater degree, and the longest interphase by far is the last one, I-IV, between mitoses IV and V. (3) The mitotic waves responsible for mitosis V move much more slowly than those for the first four mitoses and invariably decelerate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Contractile forces generated by the actomyosin cytoskeleton within individual cells collectively generate tissue-level force during epithelial morphogenesis. During Drosophila mesoderm invagination, pulsed actomyosin meshwork contractions and a ratchet-like stabilization of cell shape drive apical constriction. Here, we investigate how contractile forces are integrated across the tissue. Reducing adherens junction (AJ) levels or ablating actomyosin meshworks causes tissue-wide epithelial tears, which release tension that is predominantly oriented along the anterior-posterior (a-p) embryonic axis. Epithelial tears allow cells normally elongated along the a-p axis to constrict isotropically, which suggests that apical constriction generates anisotropic epithelial tension that feeds back to control cell shape. Epithelial tension requires the transcription factor Twist, which stabilizes apical myosin II, promoting the formation of a supracellular actomyosin meshwork in which radial actomyosin fibers are joined end-to-end at spot AJs. Thus, pulsed actomyosin contractions require a supracellular, tensile meshwork to transmit cellular forces to the tissue level during morphogenesis.},

title = {Multiscale models for vertebrate limb development},
abstract = {Dynamical systems in which geometrically extended model cells produce and interact with diffusible (morphogen) and nondiffusible (extracellular matrix) chemical fields have proved very useful as models for developmental processes. The embryonic vertebrate limb is an apt system for such mathematical and computational modeling since it has been the subject of hundreds of experimental studies, and its normal and variant morphologies and spatiotemporal organization of expressed genes are well known. Because of its stereotypical proximodistally generated increase in the number of parallel skeletal elements, the limb lends itself to being modeled by Turing-type systems which are capable of producing periodic, or quasiperiodic, arrangements of spot- and stripe-like elements. This chapter describes several such models, including, (i) a system of partial differential equations in which changing cell density enters into the dynamics explicitly, (ii) a model for morphogen dynamics alone, derived from the latter system in the "morphostatic limit" where cell movement relaxes on a much slower time-scale than cell differentiation, (iii) a discrete stochastic model for the simplified pattern formation that occurs when limb cells are placed in planar culture, and (iv) several hybrid models in which continuum morphogen systems interact with cells represented as energy-minimizing mesoscopic entities. Progress in devising computational methods for handling 3D, multiscale, multimodel simulations of organogenesis is discussed, as well as for simulating reaction-diffusion dynamics in domains of irregular shape.},

abstract = {Recording light-microscopy images of large, nontransparent specimens, such as developing multicellular organisms, is complicated by decreased contrast resulting from light scattering. Early zebrafish development can be captured by standard light-sheet microscopy, but new imaging strategies are required to obtain high-quality data of late development or of less transparent organisms. We combined digital scanned laser light-sheet fluorescence microscopy with incoherent structured-illumination microscopy (DSLM-SI) and created structured-illumination patterns with continuously adjustable frequencies. Our method discriminates the specimen-related scattered background from signal fluorescence, thereby removing out-of-focus light and optimizing the contrast of in-focus structures. DSLM-SI provides rapid control of the illumination pattern, exceptional imaging quality and high imaging speeds. We performed long-term imaging of zebrafish development for 58 h and fast multiple-view imaging of early Drosophila melanogaster development. We reconstructed cell positions over time from the Drosophila DSLM-SI data and created a fly digital embryo.},

title = {Emergent morphogenesis: Elastic mechanics of a self-deforming tissue},
abstract = {Multicellular organisms are generated by coordinated cell movements during morphogenesis. Convergent extension is a key tissue movement that organizes mesoderm, ectoderm, and endoderm in vertebrate embryos. The goals of researchers studying convergent extension, and morphogenesis in general, include understanding the molecular pathways that control cell identity, establish fields of cell types, and regulate cell behaviors. Cell identity, the size and boundaries of tissues, and the behaviors exhibited by those cells shape the developing embryo; however, there is a fundamental gap between understanding the molecular pathways that control processes within single cells and understanding how cells work together to assemble multicellular structures. Theoretical and experimental biomechanics of embryonic tissues are increasingly being used to bridge that gap. The efforts to map molecular pathways and the mechanical processes underlying morphogenesis are crucial to understanding: (1) the source of birth defects, (2) the formation of tumors and progression of cancer, and (3) basic principles of tissue engineering. In this paper, we first review the process of tissue convergent extension of the vertebrate axis and then review models used to study the self-organizing movements from a mechanical perspective. We conclude by presenting a relatively simple "wedge-model" that exhibits key emergent properties of convergent extension such as the coupling between tissue stiffness, cell intercalation forces, and tissue elongation forces.},

title = {The segment polarity network is a robust developmental module},
abstract = {All insects possess homologous segments, but segment specification differs radically among insect orders. In Drosophila, maternal morphogens control the patterned activation of gap genes, which encode transcriptional regulators that shape the patterned expression of pair-rule genes. This patterning cascade takes place before cellularization. Pair-rule gene products subsequently 'imprint' segment polarity genes with reiterated patterns, thus defining the primordial segments. This mechanism must be greatly modified in insect groups in which many segments emerge only after cellularization. In beetles and parasitic wasps, for instance, pair-rule homologues are expressed in patterns consistent with roles during segmentation, but these patterns emerge within cellular fields. In contrast, although in locusts pair-rule homologues may not control segmentation, some segment polarity genes and their interactions are conserved. Perhaps segmentation is modular, with each module autonomously expressing a characteristic intrinsic behaviour in response to transient stimuli. If so, evolution could rearrange inputs to modules without changing their intrinsic behaviours. Here we suggest, using computer simulations, that the Drosophila segment polarity genes constitute such a module, and that this module is resistant to variations in the kinetic constants that govern its behaviour.},

title = {Specification of the enveloping layer and lack of autoneuralization in zebrafish embryonic explants},
abstract = {We have analyzed the roles of cell contact during determination of the outermost enveloping layer (EVL) and deeper neurectoderm in zebrafish embryos. Outer cells, but not deeper cells, are specified to express the EVL-specific marker, cyt1 by late blastula. EVL specification requires cell contact or close cell proximity, because cyt1 is not expressed after explant dissociation. The EVL may be homologous to the Xenopus epithelial layer, including the ventral larval epidermis. While Xenopus epidermal cytokeratin gene expression is activated by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, zebrafish cyt1 is not responsive to BMPs. Zebrafish early gastrula ectodermal explants are specified to express the neural markers opl (zic1) and otx2, and this expression is prevented by BMP4. Dissociation of zebrafish explants prevents otx2 and opl expression, suggesting that neural specification in zebrafish requires cell contact or close cell proximity. This finding is in contrast to the case in Xenopus, where ectodermal dissociation leads to activation of neural gene expression, or autoneuralization. Our data suggest that distinct mechanisms direct development of homologous lineages in different vertebrates.},

title = {The cell adhesion-associated protein Git2 regulates morphogenetic movements during zebrafish embryonic development},
abstract = {Signaling through cell adhesion complexes plays a critical role in coordinating cytoskeletal remodeling necessary for efficient cell migration. During embryonic development, normal morphogenesis depends on a series of concerted cell movements; but the roles of cell adhesion signaling during these movements are poorly understood. The transparent zebrafish embryo provides an excellent system to study cell migration during development. Here, we have identified zebrafish git2a and git2b, two new members of the GIT family of genes that encode ArfGAP proteins associated with cell adhesions. Loss-of-function studies revealed an essential role for Git2a in zebrafish cell movements during gastrulation. Time-lapse microscopy analysis demonstrated that antisense depletion of Git2a greatly reduced or arrested cell migration towards the vegetal pole of the embryo. These defects were rescued by expression of chicken GIT2, indicating a specific and conserved role for Git2 in controlling embryonic cell movements. Git2a knockdown embryos showed defects in cell morphology that were associated with reduced cell contractility. We show that Git2a is required for phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), which regulates myosin II-mediated cell contractility. Consistent with this, embryos treated with Blebbistatin-a small molecule inhibitor for myosin II activity-exhibited cell movement defects similar to git2a knockdown embryos. These observations provide in vivo evidence of a physiologic role for Git2a in regulating cell morphogenesis and directed cell migration via myosin II activation during zebrafish embryonic development.},

title = {Early embryonic vascular patterning by matrix-mediated paracrine signalling: a mathematical model study},
abstract = {During embryonic vasculogenesis, endothelial precursor cells of mesodermal origin known as angioblasts assemble into a characteristic network pattern. Although a considerable amount of markers and signals involved in this process have been identified, the mechanisms underlying the coalescence of angioblasts into this reticular pattern remain unclear. Various recent studies hypothesize that autocrine regulation of the chemoattractant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is responsible for the formation of vascular networks in vitro. However, the autocrine regulation hypothesis does not fit well with reported data on in vivo early vascular development. In this study, we propose a mathematical model based on the alternative assumption that endodermal VEGF signalling activity, having a paracrine effect on adjacent angioblasts, is mediated by its binding to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Detailed morphometric analysis of simulated networks and images obtained from in vivo quail embryos reveals the model mimics the vascular patterns with high accuracy. These results show that paracrine signalling can result in the formation of fine-grained cellular networks when mediated by angioblast-produced ECM. This lends additional support to the theory that patterning during early vascular development in the vertebrate embryo is regulated by paracrine signalling.},

title = {The zebrafish dorsal axis is apparent at the four-cell stage},
abstract = {A central question in the development of multicellular organisms pertains to the timing and mechanisms of specification of the embryonic axes. In many organisms, specification of the dorsoventral axis requires signalling by proteins of the Transforming growth factor-beta and Wnt families. Here we show that maternal transcripts of the zebrafish Nodal-related morphogen, Squint (Sqt), can localize to two blastomeres at the four-cell stage and predict the dorsal axis. Removal of cells containing sqt transcripts from four-to-eight-cell embryos or injection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides targeting sqt into oocytes can cause a loss of dorsal structures. Localization of sqt transcripts is independent of maternal Wnt pathway function and requires a highly conserved sequence in the 3' untranslated region. Thus, the dorsoventral axis is apparent by early cleavage stages and may require the maternally encoded morphogen Sqt and its associated factors. Because the 3' untranslated region of the human nodal gene can also localize exogenous sequences to dorsal cells, this mechanism may be evolutionarily conserved.},

title = {Role of frizzled 7 in the regulation of convergent extension movements during gastrulation in Xenopus laevis},
abstract = {Wnt signalling plays a crucial role in the control of morphogenetic movements. We describe the expression and functional analyses of frizzled 7 (Xfz7) during gastrulation in Xenopus. Low levels of Xfz7 transcripts are expressed maternally during cleavage stages; its zygotic expression strongly increases at the beginning of gastrulation and is predominantly localized to the presumptive neuroectoderm and deep cells of the involuting mesoderm. Overexpression of Xfz7 in the dorsal equatorial region affects the movements of convergent extension and delays mesodermal involution. It alters the correct localization, but not the expression, of mesodermal and neural markers. These effects can be rescued by extra-Xfz7, which is a secreted form of the receptor that also weakly inhibits convergent extension when overexpressed. This suggests that the wild-type and truncated receptors have opposing effects when coexpressed and that overexpression of Xfz7 causes an increased signalling activity. Consistent with this, Xfz7 biochemically and functionally interacts with Xwnt11. In addition, Dishevelled, but not ({\&}bgr;)-catenin, synergizes with Xfz7 to affect convergent extension. Furthermore, overexpression of Xfz7 and Xwnt11 also affects convergent extension in activin-treated animal caps, and this can be efficiently reversed by coexpression of Cdc42(T17N), a dominant negative mutant of the small GTPase Cdc42 known as a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton. Conversely, Cdc42(G12V), a constitutively active mutant, rescues the effects of extra-Xfz7 on convergent extension in a dose-dependent manner. That both gain-of-function and loss-of-function of both frizzled and dishevelled produce the same phenotype has been well described in Drosophila tissue polarity. Therefore, our results suggest an endogenous role of Xfz7 in the regulation of convergent extension during gastrulation.},

abstract = {Apical constriction facilitates epithelial sheet bending and invagination during morphogenesis. Apical constriction is conventionally thought to be driven by the continuous purse-string-like contraction of a circumferential actin and non-muscle myosin-II (myosin) belt underlying adherens junctions. However, it is unclear whether other force-generating mechanisms can drive this process. Here we show, with the use of real-time imaging and quantitative image analysis of Drosophila gastrulation, that the apical constriction of ventral furrow cells is pulsed. Repeated constrictions, which are asynchronous between neighbouring cells, are interrupted by pauses in which the constricted state of the cell apex is maintained. In contrast to the purse-string model, constriction pulses are powered by actin-myosin network contractions that occur at the medial apical cortex and pull discrete adherens junction sites inwards. The transcription factors Twist and Snail differentially regulate pulsed constriction. Expression of snail initiates actin-myosin network contractions, whereas expression of twist stabilizes the constricted state of the cell apex. Our results suggest a new model for apical constriction in which a cortical actin-myosin cytoskeleton functions as a developmentally controlled subcellular ratchet to reduce apical area incrementally.},

title = {Single-cell internalization during zebrafish gastrulation},
abstract = {During gastrulation, germ layers are formed as prospective mesodermal and endodermal cells internalize and come to underlie the ectoderm [1-9]. Despite the pivotal role of gastrulation in animal development, the cellular interactions underlying this process are poorly understood. In zebrafish, mesoderm and endoderm formation requires the Nodal signals Cyclops and Squint and their cofactor One-eyed pinhead (Oep) [10-14]. We found that marginal cells in maternal-zygotic oep (MZoep) mutants do not internalize during gastrulation and acquire neural and tail fates at the expense of head and trunk mesendoderm. The lack of internalization in MZoep embryos and the cell-autonomous requirement for oep in Nodal signaling enabled us to test whether internalization can be achieved by individual cells or whether it depends on interactions within a group of cells. We found that individual MZoep mutant cells transplanted to the margin of wild-type blastula embryos initially internalize with their neighbors but are unable to contribute to the mesendoderm. In the reciprocal experiment, single wild-type cells transplanted to the margin of MZoep mutant embryos autonomously internalize and can express the mesendodermal markers axial/foxA2 and sox17. These results suggest that internalization and mesendoderm formation in zebrafish can be attained autonomously by single cells.},

title = {Microfluidic platform for chemotaxis in gradients formed by CXCL12 source-sink cells},
abstract = {Chemokine CXCL12 promotes CXCR4-dependent chemotaxis of cancer cells to characteristic organs and tissues, leading to metastatic disease. This study was designed to investigate how cells expressing CXCR7 regulate chemotaxis of a separate population of CXCR4 cells under physiologic conditions in which cells are exposed to gradients of CXCL12. We recapitulated a cancer-stroma microenvironment by patterning CXCR4-expressing cancer cells in microchannels at spatially defined positions relative to CXCL12-producing cells and CXCR7-expressing cells. CXCR7 scavenges and degrades CXCL12, which has been proposed to facilitate CXCR4-dependent chemotaxis through a source-sink model. Using the microchannel device, we demonstrated that chemotaxis of CXCR4 cells depended critically on the presence and location of CXCR7 cells (sink) relative to chemokine secreting cells (source). Furthermore, inhibiting CXCR4 on migrating cells or CXCR7 on sink cells blocked CXCR4-dependent chemotaxis toward CXCL12, showing that the device can identify new therapeutic agents that block migration by targeting chemoattractant scavenging receptors. Our system enables efficient chemotaxis under much shallower yet more physiological chemoattractant gradients by generating an in vitro microenvironment where combinations of cellular products may be secreted along with formation of a chemoattractant gradient. In addition to elucidating mechanisms of CXCL-12 mediated chemotaxis, this simple and robust method can be broadly useful for engineering multiple microenvironments to investigate intercellular communication.},

abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) is synthesized and secreted by embryonic cells beginning at the earliest stages of development. Our understanding of ECM composition, structure and function has grown considerably in the last several decades and this knowledge has revealed that the extracellular microenvironment is critically important for cell growth, survival, differentiation and morphogenesis. ECM and the cellular receptors that interact with it mediate both physical linkages with the cytoskeleton and the bidirectional flow of information between the extracellular and intracellular compartments. This review considers the range of cell and tissue functions attributed to ECM molecules and summarizes recent findings specific to key developmental processes. The importance of ECM as a dynamic repository for growth factors is highlighted along with more recent studies implicating the 3-dimensional organization and physical properties of the ECM as it relates to cell signaling and the regulation of morphogenetic cell behaviors. Embryonic cell and tissue generated forces and mechanical signals arising from ECM adhesion represent emerging areas of interest in this field.},

title = {Spatio-temporal regulation of Wnt and retinoic acid signaling by tbx16/spadetail during zebrafish mesoderm differentiation},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A complex network of signaling pathways and transcription factors regulates vertebrate mesoderm development. Zebrafish mutants provide a powerful tool for examining the roles of individual genes in such a network. spadetail (spt) is a mutant with a lesion in tbx16, a T-box transcription factor involved in mesoderm development; the mutant phenotype includes disrupted primitive red blood cell formation as well as disrupted somitogenesis. Despite much recent progress, the downstream targets of tbx16 remain incompletely understood. The current study was carried out to test whether any of the five major signaling pathways are regulated by tbx16 during two specific stages of mesoderm development: primitive red blood cell formation in the intermediate mesoderm and somite formation in the tail paraxial mesoderm. This test was performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, which identifies coordinated changes in expression among a priori sets of genes associated with biological features or processes. RESULTS: Our Gene Set Enrichment Analysis results identify Wnt and retinoic acid signaling as likely downstream targets of tbx16 in the developing zebrafish intermediate mesoderm, the site of primitive red blood cell formation. In addition, such results identify retinoic acid signaling as a downstream target of tbx16 in the developing zebrafish posterior somites. Finally, using candidate gene identification and in situ hybridization, we provide expression domain information for 25 additional genes downstream of tbx16 that are outside of both pathways; 23 were previously unknown downstream targets of tbx16, and seven had previously uncharacterized expression in zebrafish. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that (1) tbx16 regulates Wnt signaling in the developing zebrafish intermediate mesoderm, the site of primitive red blood cell formation, and (2) tbx16 regulates retinoic acid signaling at two distinct embryonic locations and developmental stages, which may imply ongoing spatio-temporal regulation throughout mesoderm development.},

title = {Morphogenetic domains in the yolk syncytial layer of axiating zebrafish embryos},
abstract = {The yolk syncytial layer (YSL) of the teleostean yolk cell is known to play important roles in the induction of cellular mesendoderm, as well as the patterning of dorsal tissues. To determine how this extraembryonic endodermal compartment is subdivided and morphologically transformed during early development, we have examined collective movements of vitally stained YSL nuclei in axiating zebrafish embryos by using four-dimensional confocal microscopy. During blastulation, gastrulation, and early segmentation, zebrafish YSL nuclei display several highly patterned movements, which are organized into spatially distinct morphogenetic domains along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes. During the late blastula period, with the onset of epiboly, nuclei throughout the YSL initiate longitudinal movements that are directed along the animal-vegetal axis. As epiboly progresses, nuclei progressively recede from the advancing margin of the epibolic YSL. However, a small group of nuclei is retained at the YSL margin to form a constricting blastoporal ring. During mid-gastrulation, YSL nuclei undergo convergent-extension behavior toward the dorsal midline, with a subset of nuclei forming an axial domain that underlies the notochord. These highly patterned movements of YSL nuclei share remarkable similarities to the morphogenetic movements of deep cells in the overlying zebrafish blastoderm. The macroscopic shape changes of the zebrafish yolk cell, as well as the morphogenetic movements of its YSL nuclei, are homologous to several morphogenetic behaviors that are regionally expressed within the vegetal endodermal cell mass of gastrulating Xenopus embryos. In contrast to the cellular endoderm of Xenopus, the dynamics of zebrafish YSL show that a syncytial endodermal germ layer can express a temporal sequence of morphogenetic domains without undergoing progressive steps of cell fate restriction.},

title = {Bridging the gap between developmental systems theory and evolutionary developmental biology},
abstract = {Many scientists and philosophers of science are troubled by the relative isolation of developmental from evolutionary biology. Reconciling the science of development with the science of heredity preoccupied a minority of biologists for much of the twentieth century, but these efforts were not corporately successful. Mainly in the past fifteen years, however, these previously dispersed integrating programmes have been themselves synthesized and so reinvigorated. Two of these more recent synthesizing endeavours are evolutionary developmental biology (EDB, or "evo-devo") and developmental systems theory (DST). While the former is a bourgeoning and scientifically well-respected biological discipline, the same cannot be said of DST, which is virtually unknown among biologists. In this review, we provide overviews of DST and EDB, summarize their key tenets, examine how they relate to one another and to the study of epigenetics, and survey the impact that DST and EDB have had (and in future should have) on biological theory and practice.},

The chemicals and substrates, in turn, are modeled by a simple artificial chemistry. While the system is designed to allow for the evolution of complex networks, we demonstrate the power of the artificial chemistry by analyzing engineered (handwritten) genomes that lead to the growth of simple networks with behaviors known from physiology. To evolve more complex structures, a Java-based, platform-independent, asynchronous, distributed genetic algorithm (GA) has been implemented that allows users to participate in evolutionary experiments via the World Wide Web.},

title = {Grid-free models of multicellular systems, with an application to large-scale vortices accompanying primitive streak formation},
abstract = {This paper is comprised of two parts. In the first we provide a brief overview of grid-free methods for modeling multicellular systems. We focus on an approach based on Langevin equations, in which inertia is ignored, and stochastic effects on cell motion are included. The discussion starts with simpler models, in which cells are modeled as adhesive spheres. We then turn to more sophisticated approaches in which nontrivial cell shape is accommodated, including the recently introduced Subcellular Element Model, in which each cell is described as a cluster of adhesively coupled over-damped subcellular elements, representing patches of cytoskeleton. In the second part of the paper we illustrate the use of a standard grid-free cell-based model to computationally probe interesting new features associated with primitive streak formation in the chick embryo. Streak formation is a key developmental step in amniotes (i.e., birds, reptiles, and mammals), and can be observed in detail in the chick embryo, where the streak extends across a tightly-packed two-dimensional sheet (the epiblast) comprised of about 50,000 cells. The Weijer group [Cui, Yang, Chuai, Glazier, and Weijer, Dev. Biol. 284 (2005) 37-47] recently observed that streak formation is accompanied by coordinated cell movement lateral to the streak, resulting in two large counter-rotating vortices. We study a mechanism based on cell polarity (in the plane of the epiblast) that provides an explanation for these vortices, and test it successfully using computer simulations. This mechanism is robust, since the emergent vortex formation depends only on the gross features of the initial spatial distribution of planar polarity in the epiblast.},

title = {Ovo1 links Wnt signaling with N-cadherin localization during neural crest migration},
abstract = {A fundamental issue in cell biology is how migratory cell behaviors are controlled by dynamically regulated cell adhesion. Vertebrate neural crest (NC) cells rapidly alter cadherin expression and localization at the cell surface during migration. Secreted Wnts induce some of these changes in NC adhesion and also promote specification of NC-derived pigment cells. Here, we show that the zebrafish transcription factor Ovo1 is a Wnt target gene that controls migration of pigment precursors by regulating the intracellular movements of N-cadherin (Ncad). Ovo1 genetically interacts with Ncad and its depletion causes Ncad to accumulate inside cells. Ovo1-deficient embryos strongly upregulate factors involved in intracellular trafficking, including several rab GTPases, known to modulate cellular localization of cadherins. Surprisingly, NC cells express high levels of many of these rab genes in the early embryo, chemical inhibitors of Rab functions rescue NC development in Ovo1-deficient embryos and overexpression of a Rab-interacting protein leads to similar defects in NC migration. These results suggest that Ovo proteins link Wnt signaling to intracellular trafficking pathways that localize Ncad in NC cells and allow them to migrate. Similar processes probably occur in other cell types in which Wnt signaling promotes migration.},

title = {Absence of basement membranes after targeting the LAMC1 gene results in embryonic lethality due to failure of endoderm differentiation},
abstract = {The LAMC1 gene coding for the laminin gamma1 subunit was targeted by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells. Mice heterozygous for the mutation had a normal phenotype and were fertile, whereas homozygous mutant embryos did not survive beyond day 5.5 post coitum. These embryos lacked basement membranes and although the blastocysts had expanded, primitive endoderm cells remained in the inner cell mass, and the parietal yolk sac did not develop. Cultured embryonic stem cells appeared normal after targeting both LAMC1 genes, but the embryoid bodies derived from them also lacked basement membranes, having disorganized extracellular deposits of the basement membrane proteins collagen IV and perlecan, and the cells failed to differentiate into stable myotubes. Secretion of the linking protein nidogen and a truncated laminin alpha1 subunit did occur, but these were not deposited in the extracellular matrix. These results show that the laminin gamma1 subunit is necessary for laminin assembly and that laminin is in turn essential for the organization of other basement membrane components in vivo and in vitro. Surprisingly, basement membranes are not necessary for the formation of the first epithelium to develop during embryogenesis, but first become required for extra embryonic endoderm differentiation.},

title = {Nuclear signaling by Rac and Rho GTPases is required in the establishment of epithelial planar polarity in the Drosophila eye},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The small GTPases Rac and Rho act as cellular switches in many important biological processes. In the fruit fly Drosophila, RhoA participates in the establishment of planar polarity, a process mediated by the receptor Frizzled (Fz). Thus far, analysis of Rac in this process has not been possible because of the absence of mutant Rac alleles. Here, we have investigated the role of Rac and Rho in establishing the polarity of ommatidia in the Drosophila eye. RESULTS: By expressing a dominant negative or a constitutively activated form of Rac1, we interfered specifically with Rac signaling and disrupted ommatidial polarity. The resulting defects were similar to the loss/gain-of-function phenotypes typical of tissue-polarity genes. Through genetic interaction and rescue experiments involving a polarity-specific, loss-of-function dishevelled (dsh) allele, we found that Rac1 acts downstream of Dsh in the Fz signaling pathway, but upstream of, or in parallel to, RhoA. Rac signaled to the nucleus through the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade in this process. By generating point mutations in the effector loop of RhoA, we found that RhoA also signals to the nucleus during the establishment of ommatidial polarity. Nevertheless, Rac and RhoA activated transcription of distinct target genes. CONCLUSIONS: Rac is specifically required downstream of Dsh in the Fz pathway. It functions upstream or in parallel to RhoA and both signal to the nucleus, through distinct effectors, to establish planar polarity in the Drosophila eye.},

title = {A neuron-benign microfluidic gradient generator for studying the response of mammalian neurons towards axon guidance factors},
abstract = {Investigation of biochemical cues in isolation or in combinations in cell culture systems is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms that govern neural development and repair. The most widely used experimental paradigms that elicit axon guidance in vitro utilize as the source of the gradient a pulsatile pipette, transfected cells, or a loaded gel, producing time-varying gradients of poor reproducibility which are not well suited for studying slow-growing mammalian cells. Although microfluidic device design have allowed for generating stable, complex gradients of diffusible molecules, the flow-induced shear forces in a microchannel has made it impossible to maintain viable mammalian neuronal cultures for sufficiently long times. In this paper, we describe axonal responses of mouse cortical neurons in a "neuron-benign" gradient-generator device based on an open chamber that can establish highly stable gradients of diffusible molecules for at least 6 h with negligible shear stress, and also allows the neurons to thrive for at least 2 weeks. Except for the period when the gradient is on, the cells in the gradient are under the same conditions as the cells on the control surfaces, which ensure a consistent set of micro-environmental variables. The gradient stability and uniformity over the cell culture surface achieved by the device, together with our software platform for acquiring, post-processing and quantitatively analyzing the large number of images allowed us to extract valuable information even from small datasets. We report a directed response of primary mammalian neurons (from E14 embryonic mice cortex) to a diffusible gradient of netrin in vitro. We infer from our studies that a large majority (∼73%) of the neurons that extend axons during the gradient application grow towards the netrin source, and our data analysis also indicates that netrin acts as a growth factor for this same population of neurons.},

title = {From ABC genes to regulatory networks, epigenetic landscapes and flower morphogenesis: making biological sense of theoretical approaches},
abstract = {The ABC model postulates that expression combinations of three classes of genes (A, B and C) specify the four floral organs at early stages of flower development. This classic model provides a solid framework to study flower development and has been the foundation for multiple studies in different plant species, as well as for new evolutionary hypotheses. Nevertheless, it has been shown that in spite of being necessary, these three gene classes are not sufficient for flower organ specification. Rather, flower organ specification depends on complex interactions of several genes, and probably other non-genetic factors. Being useful to study systems of complex interactions, mathematical and computational models have enlightened the origin of the A, B and C stereotyped and robust expression patterns and the process of early flower morphogenesis. Here, we present a brief introduction to basic modeling concepts and techniques and review the results that these models have rendered for the particular case of the Arabidopsis thaliana flower organ specification. One of the main results is the uncovering of a robust functional module that is sufficient to recover the gene configurations characterizing flower organ primordia. Another key result is that the temporal sequence with which such gene configurations are attained may be recovered only by modeling the aforementioned functional module as a noisy or stochastic system. Finally, modeling approaches enable testable predictions regarding the role of non-genetic factors (noise, mechano-elastic forces, etc.) in development. These predictions, along with some perspectives for future work, are also reviewed and discussed.},

title = {Morphogen-based simulation model of ray growth and joint patterning during fin development and regeneration},
abstract = {The fact that some organisms are able to regenerate organs of the correct shape and size following amputation is particularly fascinating, but the mechanism by which this occurs remains poorly understood. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) caudal fin has emerged as a model system for the study of bone development and regeneration. The fin comprises 16 to 18 bony rays, each  containing multiple joints along its proximodistal axis that give rise to segments. Experimental observations on fin ray growth,  regeneration and joint formation have been described, but no unified theory has yet been put forward to explain how growth and joint patterns are controlled. We present a model for the control of fin ray growth during development and regeneration, integrated with a model for joint pattern formation, which is in agreement with published, as well as new, experimental data. We propose that fin ray growth and joint patterning are coordinated through the interaction of three morphogens. When the 
model is extended to incorporate multiple rays across the fin, it also accounts for how the caudal fin acquires its shape during 
development, and regains its correct size and shape following amputation.},

title = {Imaging of cell migration},
abstract = {Cell migration is an essential process during many phases of development and adult life. Cells can either migrate as individuals or move in the context of tissues. Movement is controlled by internal and external signals, which activate complex signal transduction cascades resulting in highly dynamic and localised remodelling of the cytoskeleton, cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions. To understand these processes, it will be necessary to identify the critical structural cytoskeletal components, their spatio-temporal dynamics as well as those of the signalling pathways that control them. Imaging plays an increasingly important and powerful role in the analysis of these spatio-temporal dynamics. We will highlight a variety of imaging techniques and their use in the investigation of various aspects of cell motility, and illustrate their role in the characterisation of chemotaxis in Dictyostelium and cell movement during gastrulation in chick embryos in more detail.},

title = {Open access microfluidic device for the study of cell migration during chemotaxis},
abstract = {Cells sense and interpret chemical gradients, and respond by localized responses that lead to directed migration. An open microfluidic device (OMD) was developed to provide quantitative information on both the gradient and morphological changes that occurred as cells crawled through various microfabricated channels. This device overcame problems that many current devices have been plagued with, such as complicated cell loading, media evaporation and channel blockage by air bubbles. We used a micropipette to set up stable gradients formed by passive diffusion and thus avoided confounding cellular responses produced by shear forces. Two versions of the OMD are reported here: one device that has channels with widths of 6, 8, 10 and 12 μm, while the other has two large 100 μm channels to minimize cellular interaction with lateral walls. These experiments compared the migration rates and qualitative behavior of Dictyostelium discoideum cells responding to measurable cAMP and folic acid gradients in small and large channels. We report on the influence that polarity has on a cell's ability to migrate when confined in a channel. Polarized cells that migrated to cAMP were significantly faster than the unpolarized cells that crawled toward folic acid. Unpolarized cells in wide channels often strayed off course, yet migrated faster than unpolarized cells in confined channels. Cells in channels farthest from the micropipette migrated through the channels at rates similar to cells in channels with higher concentrations, suggesting that cell speed was independent of mean concentration. Lastly, it was found that the polarized cells could easily change migration direction even when only the leading edge of the cell was exposed to a lateral gradient.},

title = {Surface tensions of embryonic tissues predict their mutual envelopment behavior},
abstract = {During embryonic development, certain tissues stream to their destinations by liquidlike spreading movements. According to the 'differential adhesion hypothesis', these movements are guided by cell-adhesion-generated tissue surface tensions (sigmas), operating in the same manner as surface tensions do in the mutual spreading behavior of immiscible liquids, among which the liquid of lower surface tension is always the one that spreads over its partner. In order to conduct a direct physical test of the 'differential adhesion hypothesis', we have measured the sigmas of aggregates of five chick embryonic tissues, using a parallel plate compression apparatus specifically designed for this purpose, and compared the measured values with these tissues' mutual spreading behaviors. We show that aggregates of each of these tissues behave for a time as elasticoviscous liquids with characteristic surface tension values. Chick embryonic limb bud mesoderm (sigma = 20.1 dyne/cm) is enveloped by pigmented epithelium (sigma = 12.6 dyne/cm) which, in turn, is enveloped by heart (sigma = 8.5 dyne/cm) which, in turn, is enveloped by liver (sigma = 4.6 dyne/cm) which, in turn, is enveloped by neural retina (sigma = 1.6 dyne/cm). Thus, as predicted, the tissues' surface tension values fall in the precise sequence required to account for their mutual envelopment behavior.},

abstract = {The translocon is a protein-conducting channel conserved over all domains of life that serves to translocate proteins across or into membranes. Although this channel has been well studied for many years, the recent discovery of a high-resolution crystal structure opens up new avenues of exploration. Taking advantage of this, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the translocon in a fully solvated lipid bilayer, examining the translocation abilities of monomeric SecYEbeta by forcing two helices comprised of different amino acid sequences to cross the channel. The simulations revealed that the so-called plug of SecYEbeta swings open during translocation, closing thereafter. Likewise, it was established that the so-called pore ring region of SecYEbeta forms an elastic, yet tight, seal around the translocating oligopeptides. The closed state of the channel was found to block permeation of all ions and water molecules; in the open state, ions were blocked. Our results suggest that the SecYEbeta monomer is capable of forming an active channel.},

title = {Regionally autonomous segmentation within zebrafish presomitic mesoderm},
abstract = {Similar to chick, mouse, and Xenopus, a number of intercellular signaling pathways are required for zebrafish segmentation. However, the spatial scales over which these signaling pathways operate in zebrafish remain largely unknown. During zebrafish segmentation, waves of her1 transcription (a) initiate within the tailbud region, (b) propagate anteriorly through presomitic mesoderm (PSM), and (c) terminate in the anlage of newly-forming somites. These observations raise the question of whether the tailbud region serves as a "pacemaker" or "organizing center" for the initiation of propagating her1 expression waves. Microsurgical manipulations reveal that the anteriorly waves of her1 transcription are not perturbed by removal of the zebrafish tailbud. Furthermore, expression patterns of deltaD, paraxial protocadherin C (papc), and myoD within recently formed somites also appear to be relatively unperturbed by either removal of the tailbud, or by removal of lateral plate mesoderm. Although dynamic gene networks rapidly specify mesenchymal or epithelial cellular identities within forming somites, this specification is plastic. Time-lapse analysis has shown that the cellular progeny of mitotically-active epithelial border cells within newly formed somites can adopt different cellular identities than their precursor cells. Overall, these results indicate that sustained long-range intercellular communication with the tailbud, anterior somites, or lateral plate mesoderm is not necessary for segmentation or somitogenesis to proceed within the PSM. The basic segmentation and somitogenesis processes in zebrafish presomitic mesoderm appear to be largely regionally autonomous and governed by local morphogenetic cell behaviors.},

abstract = {Cytosine DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark present in many eukaryotic organisms. Although DNA methylation likely has a conserved role in gene silencing, the levels and patterns of DNA methylation appear to vary drastically among different organisms. Here we used shotgun genomic bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) to compare DNA methylation in eight diverse plant and animal genomes. We found that patterns of methylation are very similar in flowering plants with methylated cytosines detected in all sequence contexts, whereas CG methylation predominates in animals. Vertebrates have methylation throughout the genome except for CpG islands. Gene body methylation is conserved with clear preference for exons in most organisms. Furthermore, genes appear to be the major target of methylation in Ciona and honey bee. Among the eight organisms, the green alga Chlamydomonas has the most unusual pattern of methylation, having non-CG methylation enriched in exons of genes rather than in repeats and transposons. In addition, the Dnmt1 cofactor Uhrf1 has a conserved function in maintaining CG methylation in both transposons and gene bodies in the mouse, Arabidopsis, and zebrafish genomes.},

title = {Efficient reverse-engineering of a developmental gene regulatory network},
abstract = {Understanding the complex regulatory networks underlying development and evolution of multi-cellular organisms is a major problem in biology. Computational models can be used as tools to extract the regulatory structure and dynamics of such networks from gene expression data. This approach is called reverse engineering. It has been successfully applied to many gene networks in various biological systems. However, to reconstitute the structure and non-linear dynamics of a developmental gene network in its spatial context remains a considerable challenge. Here, we address this challenge using a case study: the gap gene network involved in segment determination during early development of Drosophila melanogaster. A major problem for reverse-engineering pattern-forming networks is the significant amount of time and effort required to acquire and quantify spatial gene expression data. We have developed a simplified data processing pipeline that considerably increases the throughput of the method, but results in data of reduced accuracy compared to those previously used for gap gene network inference. We demonstrate that we can infer the correct network structure using our reduced data set, and investigate minimal data requirements for successful reverse engineering. Our results show that timing and position of expression domain boundaries are the crucial features for determining regulatory network structure from data, while it is less important to precisely measure expression levels. Based on this, we define minimal data requirements for gap gene network inference. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of reverse-engineering with much reduced experimental effort. This enables more widespread use of the method in different developmental contexts and organisms. Such systematic application of data-driven models to real-world networks has enormous potential. Only the quantitative investigation of a large number of developmental gene regulatory networks will allow us to discover whether there are rules or regularities governing development and evolution of complex multi-cellular organisms.},

title = {Coordinated action of N-CAM, N-cadherin, EphA4, and ephrinB2 translates genetic prepatterns into structure during somitogenesis in chick},
abstract = {During gastrulation in vertebrates, mesenchymal cells at the anterior end of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) periodically compact, transiently epithelialize and detach from the posterior PSM to form somites. In the prevailing clock-and-wavefront model of somitogenesis, periodic gene expression, particularly of Notch and Wnt, interacts with an FGF8-based thresholding mechanism to determine cell fates. However, this model does not explain how cell determination and subsequent differentiation translates into somite morphology. In this paper, we use computer simulations of chick somitogenesis to show that experimentally-observed temporal and spatial patterns of adhesive N-CAM and N-cadherin and repulsive EphA4-ephrinB2 pairs suffice to reproduce the complex dynamic morphological changes of somitogenesis in wild-type and N-cadherin (-/-) chick, including intersomitic separation, boundary-shape evolution and sorting of misdifferentiated cells across compartment boundaries. Since different models of determination yield the same, experimentally-observed, distribution of adhesion and repulsion molecules, the patterning is independent of the details of this mechanism.},

title = {B1 SOX coordinate cell specification with patterning and morphogenesis in the early zebrafish embryo},
abstract = {The B1 SOX transcription factors SOX1/2/3/19 have been implicated in various processes of early embryogenesis. However, their regulatory functions in stages from the blastula to early neurula remain largely unknown, primarily because loss-of-function studies have not been informative to date. In our present study, we systematically knocked down the B1 sox genes in zebrafish. Only the quadruple knockdown of the four B1 sox genes sox2/3/19a/19b resulted in very severe developmental abnormalities, confirming that the B1 sox genes are functionally redundant. We characterized the sox2/3/19a/19b quadruple knockdown embryos in detail by examining the changes in gene expression through in situ hybridization, RT-PCR, and microarray analyses. Importantly, these phenotypic analyses revealed that the B1 SOX proteins regulate the following distinct processes: (1) early dorsoventral patterning by controlling bmp2b/7; (2) gastrulation movements via the regulation of pcdh18a/18b and wnt11, a non-canonical Wnt ligand gene; (3) neural differentiation by regulating the Hes-class bHLH gene her3 and the proneural-class bHLH genes neurog1 (positively) and ascl1a (negatively), and regional transcription factor genes, e.g., hesx1, zic1, and rx3; and (4) neural patterning by regulating signaling pathway genes, cyp26a1 in RA signaling, oep in Nodal signaling, shh, and mdkb. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the her3, hesx1, neurog1, pcdh18a, and cyp26a1 genes further suggests a direct regulation of these genes by B1 SOX. We also found an interesting overlap between the early phenotypes of the B1 sox quadruple knockdown embryos and the maternal-zygotic spg embryos that are devoid of pou5f1 activity. These findings indicate that the B1 SOX proteins control a wide range of developmental regulators in the early embryo through partnering in part with Pou5f1 and possibly with other factors, and suggest that the B1 sox functions are central to coordinating cell fate specification with patterning and morphogenetic processes occurring in the early embryo.},

title = {Computer simulation of emerging asymmetry in the mouse blastocyst},
abstract = {The mechanism of embryonic polarity establishment in mammals has long been controversial. Whereas some claim prepatterning in the egg, we recently presented evidence that mouse embryonic polarity is not established until blastocyst and proposed the mechanical constraint model. Here we apply computer simulation to clarify the minimal cellular properties required for this morphology. The simulation is based on three assumptions: (1) behavior of cell aggregates is simulated by a 3D vertex dynamics model; (2) all cells have equivalent mechanical properties; (3) an inner cavity with equivalent surface properties is gradually enlarged. However, an initial attempt reveals a requirement for an additional assumption: (4) the surface of the cavity is firmer than intercellular surfaces, suggesting the presence of a basement membrane lining the blastocyst cavity, which is indeed confirmed by published data. The simulation thus successfully produces a structure recapitulating the mouse blastocyst. The axis of the blastocyst, however, remains variable, leading us to an additional assumption: (5) the aggregate is enclosed by a capsule, equivalent to the zona pellucida in vivo. Whereas a spherical capsule does not stabilize the blastocyst axis, an ellipsoidal capsule eventually orients the axis in accordance with its longest diameter. These predictions are experimentally verified by time-lapse recordings of mouse embryos. During simulation, equivalent cells form two distinct populations composed of smaller inner cells and larger outer cells. These results reveal a unique feature of early mammalian development: an asymmetry may emerge autonomously in an equivalent population with no need for a priori intrinsic differences.},

abstract = {Formation of the mammalian primitive streak appears to rely on cell proliferation to a minor extent only, but compensating cell movements have not yet been directly observed. This study analyses individual cell migration and proliferation simultaneously, using multiphoton and differential interference contrast time-lapse microscopy of late pregastrulation rabbit blastocysts. Epiblast cells in the posterior gastrula extension area accumulated medially and displayed complex planar movements including U-turns and a novel type of processional cell movement. In the same area metaphase plates tended to be aligned parallel to the anterior-posterior axis, and statistical analysis showed that rotations of metaphase plates causing preferred orientation were near-complete 8 min before anaphase onset; in some cases, rotations were strikingly rapid, achieving up to 45$\,^{\circ}$ per min. The mammalian primitive streak appears to be formed initially with its typically minimal anteroposterior elongation by a combination of oriented cell divisions with dedicated planar cell movements.

title = {Somites in zebrafish doubly mutant for knypek and trilobite form without internal mesenchymal cells or compaction},
abstract = {In vertebrates, paraxial mesoderm is partitioned into repeating units called somites. It is thought that the mechanical forces arising from compaction of the presumptive internal cells of prospective somites cause them to detach from the unsegmented presomitic mesoderm [1-3]. To determine how prospective somites physically segregate from each other, we used time-lapse microscopy to analyze the mechanics underlying early somitogenesis in wild-type zebrafish and in the mutants trilobite(m209) (tri), knypek(m119) (kny), and kny;tri, which are defective in convergent extension during gastrulation. Formation of somite boundaries in all of these embryos involved segregation, local alignment, and cell-shape changes of presumptive epitheloid border cells along nascent intersomitic boundaries. Although kny;tri somites formed without convergence of the presomitic mesoderm and were composed of only two cells in their anteroposterior (AP) dimension, they still exhibited AP intrasegmental polarity. Furthermore, morphogenesis of somite boundaries in these embryos proceeded in a manner similar to that in wild-type embryos. Thus, intersomitic boundary formation in zebrafish involves short-range movements of presumptive border cells that do not require mechanical forces generated by internal cells or compaction of the presomitic mesoderm.},

title = {Gradient sensing in defined chemotactic fields},
abstract = {Cells respond to a variety of secreted molecules by modifying their physiology, growth patterns, and behavior. Motile bacteria and eukaryotic cells can sense extracellular chemoattractants and chemorepellents and alter their movement. In this way fibroblasts and leukocytes can find their way to sites of injury and cancer cells can home in on sites that are releasing growth factors. Social amoebae such as Dictyostelium are chemotactic to cAMP which they secrete several hours after they have initiated development. These eukaryotic cells are known to be able to sense extremely shallow gradients but the processes underlying their exquisite sensitivity are still largely unknown. In this study we determine the responses of developed cells of Dictyostelium discoideum to stable linear gradients of cAMP of varying steepness generated in 2 μm deep gradient chambers of microfluidic devices. The gradients are generated by molecular diffusion between two 80 μm deep flow-through channels, one of which is perfused with a solution of cAMP and the other with buffer, serving as continuously replenished source and sink. These low ceiling gradient chambers constrained the cells in the vertical dimension, facilitating confocal imaging, such that subcellular localization of fluorescently tagged proteins could be followed for up to 30 min without noticeable phototoxicity. Chemotactic cells enter these low ceiling chambers by flattening and elongating and then move almost as rapidly as unconstrained cells. By following the localization of activated Ras (RasGTP) using a Ras Binding Domain fused to Green Fluorescent Protein (RBD-GFP), we observed the rapid appearance of membrane associated patches at the tips of pseudopods. These patches remained associated with pseudopods while they continued to extend but were rapidly disassembled when pseudopods stalled and the cell moved past them. Likewise, fluorescence associated with localized RasGTP rapidly disappeared when the gradient was turned off. Correlation of the size and persistence of RasGTP patches with extension of pseudopods may set the rules for understanding how the signal transduction mechanisms convert a weak external signal to a strong directional bias.},

title = {Time-lapse analysis and mathematical characterization elucidate novel mechanisms underlying muscle morphogenesis},
abstract = {Skeletal muscle morphogenesis transforms short muscle precursor cells into long, multinucleate myotubes that anchor to tendons via the myotendinous junction (MTJ). In vertebrates, a great deal is known about muscle specification as well as how somitic cells, as a cohort, generate the early myotome. However, the cellular mechanisms that generate long muscle fibers from short cells and the molecular factors that limit elongation are unknown. We show that zebrafish fast muscle fiber morphogenesis consists of three discrete phases: short precursor cells, intercalation/elongation, and boundary capture/myotube formation. In the first phase, cells exhibit randomly directed protrusive activity. The second phase, intercalation/elongation, proceeds via a two-step process: protrusion extension and filling. This repetition of protrusion extension and filling continues until both the anterior and posterior ends of the muscle fiber reach the MTJ. Finally, both ends of the muscle fiber anchor to the MTJ (boundary capture) and undergo further morphogenetic changes as they adopt the stereotypical, cylindrical shape of myotubes. We find that the basement membrane protein laminin is required for efficient elongation, proper fiber orientation, and boundary capture. These early muscle defects in the absence of either lamininbeta1 or laminingamma1 contrast with later dystrophic phenotypes in lamininalpha2 mutant embryos, indicating discrete roles for different laminin chains during early muscle development. Surprisingly, genetic mosaic analysis suggests that boundary capture is a cell-autonomous phenomenon. Taken together, our results define three phases of muscle fiber morphogenesis and show that the critical second phase of elongation proceeds by a repetitive process of protrusion extension and protrusion filling. Furthermore, we show that laminin is a novel and critical molecular cue mediating fiber orientation and limiting muscle cell length.},

title = {A laser pointer driven microheater for precise local heating and conditional gene regulation in vivo},
abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Tissue heating has been employed to study a variety of biological processes, including the study of genes that control embryonic development. Conditional regulation of gene expression is a particularly powerful approach for understanding gene function. One popular method for mis-expressing a gene of interest employs heat-inducible heat shock protein (hsp) promoters. Global heat shock of hsp-promoter-containing transgenic animals induces gene expression throughout all tissues, but does not allow for spatial control. Local heating allows for spatial control of hsp-promoter-driven transgenes, but methods for local heating are cumbersome and variably effective. RESULTS: We describe a simple, highly controllable, and versatile apparatus for heating biological tissue and other materials on the micron-scale. This microheater employs micron-scale fiber optics and uses an inexpensive laser-pointer as a power source. Optical fibers can be pulled on a standard electrode puller to produce tips of varying sizes that can then be used to reliably heat 20-100 um targets. We demonstrate precise spatiotemporal control of hsp70l:GFP transgene expression in a variety of tissue types in zebrafish embryos and larvae. We also show how this system can be employed as part of a new method for lineage tracing that would greatly facilitate the study of organogenesis and tissue regulation at any time in the life cycle. CONCLUSION: This versatile and simple local heater has broad utility for the study of gene function and for lineage tracing. This system could be used to control hsp-driven gene expression in any organism simply by bringing the fiber optic tip in contact with the tissue of interest. Beyond these uses for the study of gene function, this device has wide-ranging utility in materials science and could easily be adapted for therapeutic purposes in humans.},

title = {Relating biophysical properties across scales},
abstract = {A distinguishing feature of a multicellular living system is that it operates at various scales, from the intracellular to organismal. Genes and molecules set up the conditions for the physical processes to act, in particular to shape the embryo. As development continues the changes brought about by the physical processes lead to changes in gene expression. It is this coordinated interplay between genetic and generic (i.e., physical and chemical) processes that constitutes the modern understanding of early morphogenesis. It is natural to assume that in this multiscale process the smaller defines the larger. In case of biophysical properties, in particular, those at the subcellular level are expected to give rise to those at the tissue level and beyond. Indeed, the physical properties of tissues vary greatly from the liquid to solid. Very little is known at present on how tissue level properties are related to cell and subcellular properties. Modern measurement techniques provide quantitative results at both the intracellular and tissue level, but not on the connection between these. In the present work we outline a framework to address this connection. We specifically concentrate on the morphogenetic process of tissue fusion, by following the coalescence of two contiguous multicellular aggregates. The time evolution of this process can accurately be described by the theory of viscous liquids. We also study fusion by Monte Carlo simulations and a novel Cellular Particle Dynamics (CPD) model, which is similar to the earlier introduced Subcellular Element Model (SEM; Newman, 2005). Using the combination of experiments, theory and modeling we are able to relate the measured tissue level biophysical quantities to subcellular parameters. Our approach has validity beyond the particular morphogenetic process considered here and provides a general way to relate biophysical properties across scales.},

abstract = {Cell aggregates are a tool for in vitro studies of morphogenesis, cancer invasion, and tissue engineering. They respond to mechanical forces as a complex rather than simple liquid. To change an aggregate's shape, cells have to overcome energy barriers. If cell shape fluctuations are active enough, the aggregate spontaneously relaxes stresses ("fluctuation-induced flow"). If not, changing the aggregate's shape requires a sufficiently large applied stress ("stress-induced flow"). To capture this distinction, we develop a mechanical model of aggregates based on their cellular structure. At stress lower than a characteristic stress tau*, the aggregate as a whole flows with an apparent viscosity eta*, and at higher stress it is a shear-thinning fluid. An increasing cell-cell tension results in a higher eta* (and thus a slower stress relaxation time t(c)). Our constitutive equation fits experiments of aggregate shape relaxation after compression or decompression in which irreversibility can be measured; we find t(c) of the order of 5 h for F9 cell lines. Predictions also match numerical simulations of cell geometry and fluctuations. We discuss the deviations from liquid behavior, the possible overestimation of surface tension in parallel-plate compression measurements, and the role of measurement duration.},

title = {Frizzled-7 signalling controls tissue separation during Xenopus gastrulation},
abstract = {Cell signalling through Frizzled receptors has evolved to considerable complexity within the metazoans. The Frizzled-dependent signalling cascade comprises several branches, whose differential activation depends on specific Wnt ligands, Frizzled receptor isoforms and the cellular context. In Xenopus laevis embryos, the canonical beta-catenin pathway contributes to the establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis. A different branch, referred to as the planar cell polarity pathway, is essential for cell polarization during elongation of the axial mesoderm by convergent extension. Here we demonstrate that a third branch of the cascade is independent of Dishevelled function and involves signalling through trimeric G proteins and protein kinase C (PKC). During gastrulation, Frizzled-7 (Fz7)-dependent PKC signalling controls cell-sorting behaviour in the mesoderm. Loss of zygotic Fz7 function results in the inability of involuted anterior mesoderm to separate from the ectoderm, which leads to severe gastrulation defects. This result provides a developmentally relevant in vivo function for the Fz/PKC pathway in vertebrates.},

However, the signals that position each boundary remain unclear. Here, we report that FGF8 which is expressed in the posterior PSM, generates a moving wavefront at which level both segment boundary position and axial identity become determined. Furthermore, by manipulating boundary position in the chick embryo, we show that Hox gene expression is maintained in the appropriately numbered somite rather than at an absolute axial position.

abstract = {How embryos are shaped during development has inspired the work of many, embryologists, geneticists, but also mathematicians such as Turing, and physicists. Despite the inherent complexity of the problems it tackles, developmental biology has produced one of the most spectacular conceptual achievements, demonstrating that embryos are built with conserved molecules that orchestrate pattern and morphogenesis. As the logic of development now emerges, new challenges arise, such as how tissue mechanics is controlled. Quantitative approaches and computational models are essential to predict tissue organization and cell shapes. I review briefly how physical concepts have fueled this research in the past decades.},

title = {Cooperation of polarized cell intercalations drives convergence and extension of presomitic mesoderm during zebrafish gastrulation},
abstract = {During vertebrate gastrulation, convergence and extension (C{\&}E) movements narrow and lengthen the embryonic tissues, respectively. In zebrafish, regional differences of C{\&}E movements have been observed; however, the underlying cell behaviors are poorly understood. Using time-lapse analyses and computational modeling, we demonstrate that C{\&}E of the medial presomitic mesoderm is achieved by cooperation of planar and radial cell intercalations. Radial intercalations preferentially separate anterior and posterior neighbors to promote extension. In knypek;trilobite noncanonical Wnt mutants, the frequencies of cell intercalations are altered and the anteroposterior bias of radial intercalations is lost. This provides evidence for noncanonical Wnt signaling polarizing cell movements between different mesodermal cell layers. We further show using fluorescent fusion proteins that during dorsal mesoderm C{\&}E, the noncanonical Wnt component Prickle localizes at the anterior cell edge, whereas Dishevelled is enriched posteriorly. Asymmetrical localization of Prickle and Dishevelled to the opposite cell edges in zebrafish gastrula parallels their distribution in fly, and suggests that noncanonical Wnt signaling defines distinct anterior and posterior cell properties to bias cell intercalations.},

abstract = {The shaping of the vertebrate embryonic body plan depends heavily on the narrowing and lengthening (convergence and extension) of embryonic tissues by cell intercalation, a process by which cells actively crawl between one another along the axis of convergence to produce a narrower, longer array. We discuss recent evidence that the vertebrate non-canonical Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway, known to directly function in polarizing the movements of intercalating cells, is also involved in the localized assembly of extracellular matrix (ECM). These cell-ECM interactions, in turn, are necessary for expression of the oriented, polarized cell intercalation. The mechanism of PCP/ECM interactions, their molecular signaling, and their mechanical consequences for morphogenesis are discussed with the goal of identifying important unsolved issues.},

title = {Visualisation and quantification of morphogen gradient formation in the zebrafish},
abstract = {During embryonic development, signalling molecules known as morphogens act in a concentration-dependent manner to provide positional information to responding tissues. In the early zebrafish embryo, graded signalling by members of the nodal family induces the formation of mesoderm and endoderm, thereby patterning the embryo into three germ layers. Nodal signalling has also been implicated in the establishment of the dorso-ventral axis of the embryo. Although one can infer the existence of nodal gradients by comparing gene expression patterns in wild-type embryos and embryos in which nodal signalling is diminished or augmented, real understanding can only come from directly observing the gradients. One approach is to determine local ligand concentrations in the embryo, but this is technically challenging, and the presence of inhibitors might cause the effective concentration of a ligand to differ from its actual concentration. We have therefore taken two approaches to visualise a direct response to nodal signalling. In the first, we have used transgenic embryos to study the nuclear accumulation of a Smad2-Venus fusion protein, and in the second we have used bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualise the formation of a complex between Smad2 and Smad4. This has allowed us to visualise, in living embryos, the formation of a graded distribution of nodal signalling activity. We have quantified the formation of the gradient in time and space, and our results not only confirm that nodal signalling patterns the embryo into three germ layers, but also shed light on its role in patterning the dorso-ventral axis and highlight unexpected complexities of mesodermal patterning.},

We define seven broad periods of embryogenesis--the zygote, cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, pharyngula, and hatching periods. These divisions highlight the changing spectrum of major developmental processes that occur during the first 3 days after fertilization, and we review some of what is known about morphogenesis and other significant events that occur during each of the periods. Stages subdivide the periods. Stages are named, not numbered as in most other series, providing for flexibility and continued evolution of the staging series as we learn more about development in this species. The stages, and their names, are based on morphological features, generally readily identified by examination of the live embryo with the dissecting stereomicroscope. The descriptions also fully utilize the optical transparancy of the live embryo, which provides for visibility of even very deep structures when the embryo is examined with the compound microscope and Nomarski interference contrast illumination. Photomicrographs and composite camera lucida line drawings characterize the stages pictorially. Other figures chart the development of distinctive characters used as staging aid signposts.},

Cell shape is the product of a cell's material and active properties balanced by external forces. Control of cell shape, therefore, relies on both tight regulation of intracellular mechanics and the cell's physical interaction with its environment. In this review, we first discuss the biological and physical mechanisms of cell shape control. We next examine a number of developmental processes in which cell shape change - either individually or in a coordinated manner - drives embryonic morphogenesis and discuss how cell shape is controlled in these processes. Finally, we emphasize that cell shape control during tissue morphogenesis can only be fully understood by using a combination of cellular, molecular, developmental and biophysical approaches.},

title = {Cell autonomous commitment to an endodermal fate and behaviour by activation of Nodal signalling},
abstract = {In vertebrates the endoderm germ layer gives rise to most tissues of the digestive tract and controls head and heart morphogenesis. The induction of endoderm development relies on extracellular signals related to Nodals and propagated intracellularly by TGFbeta type I receptors ALK4/Taram-A. It is unclear, however, whether Nodal/ALK4/Taram-A signalling is involved only in the specification of endodermal precursors or plays a more comprehensive role in the activation of the endodermal program leading to the irreversible commitment of cells to the endodermal fate. Using cell transplantation experiments in zebrafish, we show that marginal cells become committed to endoderm at the onset of gastrulation and that commitment to endoderm can be reached by intracellular activation of the Nodal pathway induced by expression of an activated form of the taram-A receptor, Tar*. In a manner similar to endoderm progenitors, Tar*-activated blastomeres translocate from their initial site of implantation in the blastoderm to reach the surface of their migration substratum, the yolk syncitial layer, where they join endogenous endodermal derivatives during gastrulation and differentiate according to their anteroposterior position. We demonstrate that Nodal/Tar*-induced commitment does not rely on a secondary signal released by Tar*-expressing cells or a signal released by endogenous endoderm since Tar*-expressing wild-type cells can restore endoderm derivatives when transplanted into the endoderm-deficient mutant casanova. Likewise, the YSL does not appear essential for the maintenance of endodermal identity during gastrulation once the Nodal pathway has been activated. Thus, our results demonstrate that the activation of Nodal signalling is sufficient to commit cells both to an endodermal fate and behaviour. Wild-type endoderm implantation into casanova embryos rescues, in a non-autonomous fashion, the defective fusion of the two heart primordia in the midline, highlighting the importance of endoderm for normal heart morphogenesis.},

title = {Equivalent genetic roles for bmp7/snailhouse and bmp2b/swirl in dorsoventral pattern formation},
abstract = {A bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway acts in the establishment of the dorsoventral axis of the vertebrate embryo. Here we demonstrate the genetic requirement for two different Bmp ligand subclass genes for dorsoventral pattern formation of the zebrafish embryo. From the relative efficiencies observed in Bmp ligand rescue experiments, conserved chromosomal synteny, and isolation of the zebrafish bmp7 gene, we determined that the strongly dorsalized snailhouse mutant phenotype is caused by a mutation in the bmp7 gene. We show that the original snailhouse allele is a hypomorphic mutation and we identify a snailhouse/bmp7 null mutant. We demonstrate that the snailhouse/bmp7 null mutant phenotype is identical to the presumptive null mutant phenotype of the strongest dorsalized zebrafish mutant swirl/bmp2b, revealing equivalent genetic roles for these two Bmp ligands. Double mutant snailhouse/bmp7; swirl/bmp2b embryos do not exhibit additional or stronger dorsalized phenotypes, indicating that these Bmp ligands do not function redundantly in early embryonic development. Furthermore, overexpression experiments reveal that Bmp2b and Bmp7 synergize in the ventralization of wild-type embryos through a cell-autonomous mechanism, suggesting that Bmp2b/Bmp7 heterodimers may act in vivo to specify ventral cell fates in the zebrafish embryo.},

title = {Discrete rearranging disordered patterns, part I: robust statistical tools in two or three dimensions},
abstract = {Discrete rearranging patterns include cellular patterns, for instance liquid foams, biological tissues, grains in polycrystals; assemblies of particles such as beads, granular materials, colloids, molecules, atoms; and interconnected networks. Such a pattern can be described as a list of links between neighbouring sites. Performing statistics on the links between neighbouring sites yields average quantities (hereafter "tools") as the result of direct measurements on images. These descriptive tools are flexible and suitable for various problems where quantitative measurements are required, whether in two or in three dimensions. Here, we present a coherent set of robust tools, in three steps. First, we revisit the definitions of three existing tools based on the texture matrix. Second, thanks to their more general definition, we embed these three tools in a self-consistent formalism, which includes three additional ones. Third, we show that the six tools together provide a direct correspondence between a small scale, where they quantify the discrete pattern's local distortion and rearrangements, and a large scale, where they help describe a material as a continuous medium. This enables to formulate elastic, plastic, fluid behaviours in a common, self-consistent modelling using continuous mechanics. Experiments, simulations and models can be expressed in the same language and directly compared. As an example, a companion paper (P. Marmottant, C. Raufaste, and F. Graner, this issue, 25 (2008) DOI 10.1140/epje/i2007-10300-7) provides an application to foam plasticity.},

title = {Oriented cell motility and division underlie early limb bud morphogenesis},
abstract = {The vertebrate limb bud arises from lateral plate mesoderm and its overlying ectoderm. Despite progress regarding the genetic requirements for limb development, morphogenetic mechanisms that generate early outgrowth remain relatively undefined. We show by live imaging and lineage tracing in different vertebrate models that the lateral plate contributes mesoderm to the early limb bud through directional cell movement. The direction of cell motion, longitudinal cell axes and bias in cell division planes lie largely parallel to one another along the rostrocaudal (head-tail) axis in lateral plate mesoderm. Transition of these parameters from a rostrocaudal to a mediolateral (outward from the body wall) orientation accompanies early limb bud outgrowth. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Wnt5a acts as a chemoattractant in the emerging limb bud where it contributes to the establishment of cell polarity that is likely to underlie the oriented cell behaviours.},

title = {Image matching as a diffusion process: an analogy with Maxwell's demons},
abstract = {In this paper, we present the concept of diffusing models to perform image-to-image matching. 
Having two images to match, the main idea is to consider the objects boundaries in one image 
as semi-permeable membranes and to let the other image, considered as a deformable grid 
model, diffuse through these interfaces, by the action of effectors situated within the membranes. 
We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell's demons. We show that this concept 
relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step being optical 
flow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid 
matching algorithms, one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour 
points, and a last one operating on already segmented images. Finally, we present results with 
synthesized deformations and real medical images, with applications to heart motion tracking 
and three-dimensional inter-patients matching. },

title = {A vertebrate-specific Chp-PAK-PIX pathway maintains E-cadherin at adherens junctions during zebrafish epiboly},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In early vertebrate development, embryonic tissues modulate cell adhesiveness and acto-myosin contractility to correctly orchestrate the complex processes of gastrulation. E-cadherin (E-cadh) is the earliest expressed cadherin and is needed in the mesendodermal progenitors for efficient migration. Regulatory mechanisms involving directed E-cadh trafficking have been invoked downstream of Wnt11/5 signaling. This non-canonical Wnt pathway regulates RhoA-ROK/DAAM1 to control the acto-myosin network. However, in this context nothing is known of the intracellular signals that participate in the correct localization of E-cadh, other than a need for Rab5c signaling. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By studying loss of Chp induced by morpholino-oligonucleotide injection in zebrafish, we find that the vertebrate atypical Rho-GTPase Chp is essential for the proper disposition of cells in the early embryo. The underlying defect is not leading edge F-actin assembly (prominent in the cells of the envelope layer), but rather the failure to localize E-cadh and beta-catenin at the adherens junctions. Loss of Chp results in delayed epiboly that can be rescued by mRNA co-injection, and phenocopies zebrafish E-cadh mutants. This new signaling pathway involves activation of an effector kinase PAK, and involvement of the adaptor PAK-interacting exchange factor PIX. Loss of signaling by any of the three components results in similar underlying defects, which is most prominent in the epithelial-like envelope layer. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our current study uncovers a developmental pathway involving Chp/PAK/PIX signaling, which helps co-ordinate E-cadh disposition to promote proper cell adhesiveness, and coordinate movements of the three major cell layers in epiboly. Our data shows that without Chp signaling, E-cadh shifts to intracellular vesicles rather than the adhesive contacts needed for directed cell movement. These events may mirror the requirement for PAK2 signaling essential for the proper formation of the blood-brain barrier.},

title = {Rheological analysis and measurement of neutrophil indentation},
abstract = {Aspects of neutrophil mechanical behavior relevant to the formation of adhesive contacts were assessed by measuring the dependence of the contact area between the cell and a spherical substrate under controlled loading. Micropipettes were used to bring neutrophils into contact with spherical beads under known forces, and the corresponding contact area was measured over time. The neutrophil was modeled as a viscous liquid drop with a constant cortical tension. Both the equilibrium state and the dynamics of the approach to equilibrium were examined. The equilibrium contact area increased monotonically with force in a manner consistent with a cell cortical tension of 16-24 pN/microm. The dynamic response matched predictions based on a model of the cell as a growing drop using published values for the effective viscosity of the cell. The contact pressure between the cell and substrate at equilibrium is predicted to depend on the curvature of the contacting substrate, but to be independent of the impingement force. The approach to equilibrium was rapid, such that the time-averaged stress for a two-second impingement was within 20% of the equilibrium value. These results have implications for the role of mechanical force in the formation of adhesive contacts.},

abstract = {The yolk syncytial layer (YSL) in the zebrafish embryo is a multinucleated syncytium essential for embryo development, but the molecular mechanisms underlying YSL formation remain largely unknown. Here we show that zebrafish solute carrier family 3 member 2 (Slc3a2) is expressed specifically in the YSL and that slc3a2 knockdown causes severe YSL defects including clustering of the yolk syncytial nuclei and enhanced cell fusion, accompanied by disruption of microtubule networks. Expression of a constitutively active RhoA mimics the YSL phenotypes caused by slc3a2 knockdown, whereas attenuation of RhoA or ROCK activity rescues the slc3a2-knockdown phenotypes. Furthermore, slc3a2 knockdown significantly reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src, and overexpression of a constitutively active Src restores the slc3a2-knockdown phenotypes. Our data demonstrate a signaling pathway regulating YSL formation in which Slc3a2 inhibits the RhoA/ROCK pathway via phosphorylation of c-Src to modulate YSL microtubule dynamics. This work illuminates processes at a very early stage of zebrafish embryogenesis and more generally informs the mechanism of cell dynamics during syncytium formation.},

title = {Multicellular sprouting during vasculogenesis},
abstract = {Living organisms, from bacteria to vertebrates, are well known to generate sophisticated multicellular patterns. Numerous recent interdisciplinary studies have focused on the formation and regulation of these structures. Advances in automatized microscopy allow the time-resolved tracking of embryonic development at cellular resolution over an extended area covering most of the embryo. The resulting images yield simultaneous information on the motion of multiple tissue components-both cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers. Recent studies on ECM displacements in bird embryos resulted in a method to distinguish tissue deformation and cell-autonomous motion. Patterning of the primary vascular plexus results from a collective action of primordial endothelial cells. The emerging "polygonal" vascular structure is shown to be formed by cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions: adhesion and protrusive activity (sprouting). Utilizing avb3 integrins, multicellular sprouts invade rapidly into avascular areas. Sprout elongation, in turn, depends on a continuous supply of endothelial cells. Endothelial cells migrate along the sprout, towards its tip, in a vascular endothelial (VE) cadherin-dependent process. The observed abundance of multicellular sprout formation in various in vitro and in vivo systems can be explained by a general mechanism based on preferential attraction to elongated structures. Our interacting particle model exhibits robust sprouting dynamics and results in patterns with morphometry similar to native primordial vascular plexuses--without ancillary assumptions involving chemotaxis or mechanochemical signaling.},

title = {Embryonic mesoderm and endoderm induction requires the actions of non-embryonic Nodal-related ligands and Mxtx2},
abstract = {Vertebrate mesoderm and endoderm formation requires signaling by Nodal-related ligands from the TGFβ superfamily. The factors that initiate Nodal-related gene transcription are unknown in most species and the relative contributions of Nodal-related ligands from embryonic, extraembryonic and maternal sources remain uncertain. In zebrafish, signals from the yolk syncytial layer (YSL), an extraembryonic domain, are required for mesoderm and endoderm induction, and YSL expression of nodal-related 1 (ndr1) and ndr2 accounts for a portion of this activity. A variable requirement of maternally derived Ndr1 for dorsal and anterior axis formation has also been documented. Here we show that Mxtx2 directly activates expression of ndr2 via binding to its first intron and is required for ndr2 expression in the YSL. Mxtx2 is also required for the Nodal signaling-independent expression component of the no tail a (ntla) gene, which is required for posterior (tail) mesoderm formation. Therefore, Mxtx2 defines a new pathway upstream of Nodal signaling and posterior mesoderm formation. We further show that the co-disruption of extraembryonic Ndr2, extraembryonic Ndr1 and maternal Ndr1 eliminates endoderm and anterior (head and trunk) mesoderm, recapitulating the loss of Nodal signaling phenotype. Therefore, non-embryonic sources of Nodal-related ligands account for the complete spectrum of early Nodal signaling requirements. In summary, the induction of mesoderm and endoderm depends upon the combined actions of Mxtx2 and Nodal-related ligands from non-embryonic sources.},

title = {Control of the mitotic cleavage plane by local epithelial topology},
abstract = {For nearly 150 years, it has been recognized that cell shape strongly influences the orientation of the mitotic cleavage plane (e.g., Hofmeister, 1863). However, we still understand little about the complex interplay between cell shape and cleavage-plane orientation in epithelia, where polygonal cell geometries emerge from multiple factors, including cell packing, cell growth, and cell division itself. Here, using mechanical simulations, we show that the polygonal shapes of individual cells can systematically bias the long-axis orientations of their adjacent mitotic neighbors. Strikingly, analyses of both animal epithelia and plant epidermis confirm a robust and nearly identical correlation between local cell topology and cleavage-plane orientation in vivo. Using simple mathematics, we show that this effect derives from fundamental packing constraints. Our results suggest that local epithelial topology is a key determinant of cleavage-plane orientation, and that cleavage-plane bias may be a widespread property of polygonal cell sheets in plants and animals.},

title = {Cell movements during epiboly and gastrulation in zebrafish},
abstract = {Beginning during the late blastula stage in zebrafish, cells located beneath a surface epithelial layer of the blastoderm undergo rearrangements that accompany major changes in shape of the embryo. We describe three distinctive kinds of cell rearrangements. (1) Radial cell intercalations during epiboly mix cells located deeply in the blastoderm among more superficial ones. These rearrangements thoroughly stir the positions of deep cells, as the blastoderm thins and spreads across the yolk cell. (2) Involution at or near the blastoderm margin occurs during gastrulation. This movement folds the blastoderm into two cellular layers, the epiblast and hypoblast, within a ring (the germ ring) around its entire circumference. Involuting cells move anteriorwards in the hypoblast relative to cells that remain in the epiblast; the movement shears the positions of cells that were neighbors before gastrulation. Involuting cells eventually form endoderm and mesoderm, in an anterior-posterior sequence according to the time of involution. The epiblast is equivalent to embryonic ectoderm. (3) Mediolateral cell intercalations in both the epiblast and hypoblast mediate convergence and extension movements towards the dorsal side of the gastrula. By this rearrangement, cells that were initially neighboring one another become dispersed along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Epiboly, involution and convergent extension in zebrafish involve the same kinds of cellular rearrangements as in amphibians, and they occur during comparable stages of embryogenesis.},

For some particular geometrical characteristics, the shapes of the vesicles change continuously and randomly on a slow time scale (tens of seconds) and thus exhibit conformal diffusion. This phenomenon is a reflection of the conformal degeneracy of the elastic curvature energy. Its observation sets a limit (three constraints) on the number of physical constraints relevant to the determination of the shapes of vesicles.},

title = {Determinants of leader cells in collective cell migration},
abstract = {Collective migration is a basic mechanism of cell translocation during morphogenesis, wound repair and cancer invasion. Collective movement requires cells to retain cell-cell contacts, exhibit group polarization with defined front-rear asymmetry, and consequently move as one multicellular unit. Depending on the cell type, morphology of the group and the tissue context, distinct mechanisms control the leading edge dynamics and guidance. Leading edge migration may either result from adhesion to ECM and contractile pulling, or from forward pushing. The leading edge consists of either one or few dedicated tip cells or a multicellular leading row that generate adhesion and traction towards the tissue substrate. Alternatively, a multicellular bud consisting of many cells protrudes collectively by proliferation and growth thereby mechanically expanding and pushing towards the tissue stroma. Each type of collective guidance engages distinct spatiotemporal molecular control and feedback towards rearward cells and the adjacent tissue microenvironment; these include intrinsic polarity mechanisms regulated by the interplay between cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions; or the heterotypic integration of stromal cells that adopt leader cell functions. We here classify molecular and mechanical mechanisms of leading function in collective cell migration during morphogenesis and wound repair and discuss how these are recapitulated during collective invasion of cancer cells.},

title = {Cell adhesion and the actin cytoskeleton of the enveloping layer in the zebrafish embryo during epiboly},
abstract = {As the zebrafish embryo undergoes gastrulation and epiboly, the cells of the enveloping layer (EVL) expand, covering the entire yolk cell. During the epiboly process, the EVL cells move as a coherent layer, remaining tightly attached to each other and to the underlying yolk syncytial layer (YSL). In view of the central role of the actin cytoskeleton, in both cell motility and cell-cell adhesion, we have labeled these cells in situ with fluorescent phalloidin and anti-actin antibodies. We show that, throughout their migration, the EVL cells retain a conspicuous cortical actin cytoskeletal belt coinciding with cell surface cadherins. At the margins approaching the YSL, the EVL cells extend, from their apicolateral domains, actin-rich filopodial protrusions devoid of detectable cadherin. We have studied the role of the actin cytoskeleton in the maintenance of EVL cohesion during epiboly. Cytochalasin treatment of embryos induces EVL dissociation accompanied by general detachment of the rest of the embryonic cells. In the dissociating EVL cells, the cortical actin belt undergoes fragmentation with the formation of actin aggregates; cadherins, on the other hand, remain evenly distributed at the junctional cell surface. Removal of Ca2+ by ethyleneglycolbis (amino-ethyl-ether)-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) treatment also induces cell dissociation without visible disruption of the cortical actin belt. The protein kinase inhibitor (1-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-piperazine dihydrochloride (H-7), which blocks acto-myosin contractility and disrupts actin cables in cultured cells, also potentiates cytochalasin-induced dissociation and promotes the projection of numerous actin-rich lamellipodial extensions. The fact that EVL cells produce microspike-like structures towards the YSL and are capable of lamellipodial activity lend further support to the suggestion (R.W. Keller and J.P. Trinkaus. 1987. Dev. Biol. 120: 12-24) that the EVL cells are not passively mobilized on the expanding YSL but actively participate in epiboly.},

title = {Stress related collagen ultrastructure in human aortic valves--implications for tissue engineering},
abstract = {Understanding the response of tissue structures to mechanical stress is crucial for optimization of mechanical conditioning protocols in the field of heart valve tissue engineering. In heart valve tissue, it is unclear to what extent mechanical loading affects the collagen fibril morphology. To determine if local stress affects the collagen fibril morphology, in terms of fibril diameter, its distribution, and the fibril density, this was investigated in adult native human aortic valve leaflets. Transmission electron microscopy images of collagen fibrils were analyzed at three locations: the commissures, the belly, and the fixed edge of the leaflets. Subsequently, the mechanical behavior of human aortic valves was used in a computational model to predict the stress distribution in the valve leaflet during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. The local stresses at the three locations were related to the collagen fibril morphology. The fibril diameter and density varied significantly between the measured locations, and appeared inversely related. The average fibril diameter increased from the fixed edge, to the belly, and to the commissures of the leaflets, while fibril density decreased. Interestingly, these differences corresponded well with the level of stress at the locations. The presented data showed that large tissue stress is associated with greater average fibril diameter, lower fibril density, and wider fibril size distribution compared with low stress locations in the leaflets. The findings here provide insight in the effect of mechanical loading on the collagen ultrastructure, and are valuable to improve conditioning protocols for tissue engineering.},

Several signaling pathways, such as BMP, FGF, Hedgehog, Nodal, and Wnt have well-recognized instructive roles in cell fate specification during vertebrate embryogenesis. Growing evidence indicates that BMP, Nodal, and FGF signaling also regulate cell movements, and that they do so through mechanisms distinct from those that specify cell fates. Moreover, pathways controlling cell movements can also indirectly influence cell fate specification by regulating dimensions and relative positions of interacting tissues. The current challenge is to delineate the molecular mechanisms via which the major signaling pathways regulate cell fate specification and movements, and how these two processes are coordinated to ensure normal development.},

This concentration gradient is created by the chromatin-bound RCC1 (regulator of chromosome condensation) protein, which recruits Ran to nucleosomes and activates Ran's nucleotide exchange activity. Although RCC1 has been shown to bind directly with the nucleosome, the molecular details of this interaction were not known. Here we determine the crystal structure of a complex of Drosophila RCC1 and the nucleosome core particle at 2.9 A resolution, providing an atomic view of how a chromatin protein interacts with the histone and DNA components of the nucleosome. Our structure also suggests that the Widom 601 DNA positioning sequence present in the nucleosomes forms a 145-base-pair nucleosome core particle, not the expected canonical 147-base-pair particle.},

title = {Critical review: cellular mechanobiology and amoeboid migration},
abstract = {Cell motility is important for tissue homeostasis and plays a central role in various pathologies, notably inflammation and cancer. Research into the critical processes involved in cell migration has so far mostly focused on cell adhesion and proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix. However, pharmacological interference with these processes only partially blocks cell motility in vivo. In this review we summarize the arising evidence that the mechanical properties of the cell body have a major role to play in cell motility--especially in a low-adhesion, amoeboid-like migration mode in three-dimensional tissue structures. We summarize the processes determining cell mechanics and discuss relevant measurement technologies including their applications in medical cell biology.},

title = {The mechanics of heterotypic cell aggregates: insights from computer simulations},
abstract = {Finite element-based computer simulations are used to investigate a number of phenomena, including tissue engulfment, cell sorting, and checkerboard-pattern formation, exhibited by heterotypic cell aggregates. The simulations show that these phenomena can be driven by a single equivalent force, namely a surface (or interfacial) tension, that results from cytoskeletal components and cell-cell adhesions. They also reveal that tissue engulfment, cell sorting, and checkerboard-pattern formation involve several discernible mechanical features or stages. With the aid of analytical arguments, we identify the conditions necessary for each of these phenomena. These findings are consistent with previous experimental investigations and computer simulations, but pose significant challenges to current theories of cell sorting and tissue engulfment.},

abstract = {Embryonic morphogenesis requires the execution of complex mechanisms that regulate the local behaviour of groups of cells. The orchestration of such mechanisms has been mainly deciphered through the identification of conserved families of signalling pathways that spatially and temporally control cell behaviour. However, how this information is processed to control cell shape and cell dynamics is an open area of investigation. The framework that emerges from diverse disciplines such as cell biology, physics and developmental biology points to adhesion and cortical actin networks as regulators of cell surface mechanics. In this context, a range of developmental phenomena can be explained by the regulation of cell surface tension.},

title = {An arrayed high-content chemotaxis assay for patient diagnosis},
abstract = {Chemotaxis assays are essential tools for the study of gradient sensing and directed cell migration, and have the potential to aid in the diagnosis and characterization of patients with immune disorders. Current methods are limited in their ability to meet the more demanding requirements for clinical applications. Because patient samples have a short lifespan and sometimes a limited volume (e.g. pediatrics), the operational requirements for an efficient chemotaxis assay are increased in the clinical setting. Here we describe a microscale assay platform for gradient generation that overcomes these limitations. Passive fluidic methods are leveraged to provide a reliable microfluidic gradient generation device, operable in only three pipetting steps. In addition, arrayed imaging and advanced cell tracking algorithms enabled a 50-fold increase in throughput over current methods. These methods were employed to aid in the diagnostic evaluation of an infant who presented with severe, recurrent bacterial infections. Analysis of the infant's neutrophils revealed impaired cell polarization and chemotaxis in a gradient of the chemoattractant fMLP. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with an inhibitory mutation in the Rho GTPase, Rac2. The approach also enabled a microenvironmental screen of human primary neutrophil chemotaxis on fibronectin, fibrinogen and laminin with results suggesting that fibronectin, although commonly used, may not be the most appropriate matrix protein for chemotaxis assays. Together, these findings demonstrate the use of arrayed micro-devices to aid in the diagnosis of a primary immunodeficiency disorder, and illustrate the capability for increased throughput microenvironmental studies and screening targeted to specific human diseases.},

title = {Dorsal activity of maternal squint is mediated by a non-coding function of the RNA},
abstract = {Despite extensive study, the earliest steps of vertebrate axis formation are only beginning to be elucidated. We previously showed that asymmetric localization of maternal transcripts of the conserved zebrafish TGFβ factor Squint (Sqt) in 4-cell stage embryos predicts dorsal, preceding nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. Cell ablations and antisense oligonucleotides that deplete Sqt lead to dorsal deficiencies, suggesting that localized maternal sqt functions in dorsal specification. However, based upon analysis of sqt and Nodal signaling mutants, the function and mechanism of maternal sqt was debated. Here, we show that sqt RNA may function independently of Sqt protein in dorsal specification. sqt insertion mutants express localized maternal sqt RNA. Overexpression of mutant/non-coding sqt RNA and, particularly, the sqt 3'UTR, leads to ectopic nuclear β-catenin accumulation and expands dorsal gene expression. Dorsal activity of sqt RNA requires Wnt/β-catenin but not Oep-dependent Nodal signaling. Unexpectedly, sqt ATG morpholinos block both sqt RNA localization and translation and abolish nuclear β-catenin, providing a mechanism for the loss of dorsal identity in sqt morphants and placing maternal sqt RNA upstream of β-catenin. The loss of early dorsal gene expression can be rescued by the sqt 3'UTR. Our findings identify new non-coding functions for the Nodal genes and support a model wherein sqt RNA acts as a scaffold to bind and deliver/sequester maternal factors to future embryonic dorsal.},

We report a computational study of membrane bending by BAR domains at four levels of resolution, described by 1), all-atom molecular dynamics; 2), residue-based coarse-graining (resolving single amino acids and lipid molecules); 3), shape-based coarse-graining (resolving overall protein and membrane shapes); and 4), a continuum elastic membrane model. Membrane sculpting performed by BAR domains collectively is observed in agreement with experiments. Different arrangements of BAR domains on the membrane surface are found to lead to distinct membrane curvatures and bending dynamics.},

title = {A 'chemotactic dipole' mechanism for large-scale vortex motion during primitive streak formation in the chick embryo},
abstract = {Primitive streak formation in the chick embryo involves significant coordinated cell movement lateral to the streak, in addition to the posterior-anterior movement of cells in the streak proper. Cells lateral to the streak are observed to undergo 'polonaise movements', i.e. two large counter-rotating vortices, reminiscent of eddies in a fluid. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for these movement patterns which relies on chemotactic signals emitted by a dipolar configuration of cells in the posterior region of the epiblast. The 'chemotactic dipole' consists of adjacent regions of cells emitting chemo-attractants and chemo-repellents. We motivate this idea using a mathematical analogy between chemotaxis and electrostatics, and test this idea using large-scale computer simulations. We implement active cell response to both neighboring mechanical interactions and chemotactic gradients using the Subcellular Element Model. Simulations show the emergence of large-scale vortices of cell movement. The length and time scales of vortex formation are in reasonable agreement with experimental data. We also provide quantitative estimates for the robustness of the chemotaxis dipole mechanism, which indicate that the mechanism has an error tolerance of about 10% to variation in chemotactic parameters, assuming that only 1% of the cell population is involved in emitting signals. This tolerance increases for larger populations of cells emitting signals.},

title = {Repression of the vertebrate organizer by Wnt8 is mediated by Vent and Vox},
abstract = {Dorsoventral (DV) patterning of vertebrate embryos requires the concerted action of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) and Wnt signaling pathways. In contrast to our understanding of the role of BMP in establishing ventral fates, our understanding of the role of Wnts in ventralizing embryos is less complete. Wnt8 is required for ventral patterning in both Xenopus and zebrafish; however, its mechanism of action remains unclear. We have used the zebrafish to address the requirement for Wnt8 in restricting the size of the dorsal organizer. Epistasis experiments suggest that Wnt8 achieves this restriction by regulating the early expression of the transcriptional repressors Vent and Vox. Our data show that vent and vox are direct transcriptional targets of Wnt8/beta-catenin. Additionally, we show that Wnt8 and Bmp2b co-regulate vent and vox in a dynamic fashion. Thus, whereas both Wnt8 and zygotic BMP are ventralizing agents that regulate common target genes, their temporally different modes of action are necessary to pattern the embryo harmoniously along its DV axis.},

abstract = {Ivan I. Schmalhausen was one of the central figures in the Russian development of the "Modern Synthesis" in evolutionary biology. He is widely cited internationally even today. Schmalhausen developed the main principles of his theory facing the danger of death in the totalitarian Soviet Union. His great services to evolutionary and theoretical biology are indisputable. However, the received view of Schmalhausen's contributions to evolutionary biology makes an unbiased reading of his texts difficult. Here we show that taking all of his works into consideration (including those only available in Russian) paints a much more dynamic and exciting picture of what he tried to achieve. Schmalhausen pioneered the integration of a developmental perspective into evolutionary thinking. A main tool for achieving this was his approach to living objects as complex multi-level self-regulating systems. Schmalhausen put enormous effort into bringing this idea into fruition during the final stages of his career by combining evolutionary theory with cybernetics. His results and ideas remain thought-provoking, and his texts are of more than just historical interest.},

title = {The zebrafish candyfloss mutant implicates extracellular matrix adhesion failure in laminin alpha2-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy},
abstract = {Mutations in the human laminin alpha2 (LAMA2) gene result in the most common form of congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A). There are currently three models for the molecular basis of cellular pathology in MDC1A: (i) lack of LAMA2 leads to sarcolemmal weakness and failure, followed by cellular necrosis, as is the case in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); (ii) loss of LAMA2-mediated signaling during the development and maintenance of muscle tissue results in myoblast proliferation and fusion defects; (iii) loss of LAMA2 from the basement membrane of the Schwann cells surrounding the peripheral nerves results in a lack of motor stimulation, leading to effective denervation atrophy. Here we show that the degenerative muscle phenotype in the zebrafish dystrophic mutant, candyfloss (caf) results from mutations in the laminin alpha2 (lama2) gene. In vivo time-lapse analysis of mechanically loaded fibers and membrane permeability assays suggest that, unlike DMD, fiber detachment is not initially associated with sarcolemmal rupture. Early muscle formation and myoblast fusion are normal, indicating that any deficiency in early Lama2 signaling does not lead to muscle pathology. In addition, innervation by the primary motor neurons is unaffected, and fiber detachment stems from muscle contraction, demonstrating that muscle atrophy through lack of motor neuron activity does not contribute to pathology in this system. Using these and other analyses, we present a model of lama2 function where fiber detachment external to the sarcolemma is mechanically induced, and retracted fibers with uncompromised membranes undergo subsequent apoptosis.},

Cells also experience extracellular forces, such as static forces mediated by the extracellular matrix and forces resulting from microscopic fluid flow. Although the biological ramifications of static forces have received much attention, little is known about the roles of fluid flows and forces during embryogenesis. Here, we focus on the microfluidic forces generated by cilia-driven fluid flow and heart-driven hemodynamics, as well as on the signaling pathways involved in flow sensing. We discuss recent studies that describe the functions and the biomechanical features of these fluid flows. These insights suggest that biological flow determines many aspects of cell behavior and identity through a specific set of physical stimuli and signaling pathways.},

title = {Collective cell migration in morphogenesis and cancer},
abstract = {The movement of cells that maintain cell-cell junctions yet protrude along or within tissues is an important mechanism for cell positioning in morphogenesis, tissue repair and cancer. Collective cell migration shares similarities but also important differences to individually migrating cells. Coherent groups of cells are arranged and held together by cell-cell adhesion molecules, including cadherins, integrins, ALCAM and NCAM. Integrins of the beta 1 and beta 3 families further provide polarized interactions with the extracellular tissue environment, while matrix-degrading proteases become focalized to substrate contacts to widen tissue space for the advancing cell mass. By generating one functional unit, in contrast to individual cell migration, collective migration provides the active and passive translocation of mobile and non-mobile cells, respectively. This review highlights cellular and molecular principles of collective migration in the context of morphogenic tissue patterning and tumor cell invasion.},

title = {Differential requirement for the dual functions of β-catenin in embryonic stem cell self-renewal and germ layer formation},
abstract = {Canonical Wnt signalling has been implicated in mouse and human embryonic stem cell (ESC) maintenance; however, its requirement is controversial. β-catenin is the key component in this highly conserved Wnt pathway, acting as a transcriptional transactivator. However, β-catenin has additional roles at the plasma membrane regulating cell-cell adhesion, complicating the analyses of cells/tissues lacking β-catenin. We report here the generation of a Ctnnb1 (β-catenin)-deficient mouse ESC (mESC) line and show that self-renewal is maintained in the absence of β-catenin. Cell adhesion is partially rescued by plakoglobin upregulation, but fails to be maintained during differentiation. When differentiated as aggregates, wild-type mESCs form descendants of all three germ layers, whereas mesendodermal germ layer formation and neuronal differentiation are defective in Ctnnb1-deficient mESCs. A Tcf/Lef-signalling-defective β-catenin variant, which re-establishes cadherin-mediated cell adhesion, rescues definitive endoderm and neuroepithelial formation, indicating that the β-catenin cell-adhesion function is more important than its signalling function for these processes.},

abstract = {Gastrulation involves of a series of coordinated cell movements to organize the germ layers and establish the major body axes of the embryo. One gastrulation movement is epiboly, which involves the thinning and spreading of a multilayered cell sheet. Epiboly plays a prominent role in zebrafish gastrulation and studies of zebrafish epiboly have provided insights into basic cellular properties and mechanisms of morphogenesis that are widely used in animal development. Although considerable progress has been made in identifying molecules that are required for epiboly, we still understand very little about how these factors cooperate to drive the process. Here, we review work on the molecular and cellular basis of zebrafish epiboly in order to identify unifying themes and to highlight some of the current open questions.},

title = {Zebrafish bmp4 functions during late gastrulation to specify ventroposterior cell fates},
abstract = {Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are key mediators of dorsoventral patterning in vertebrates and are required for the induction of ventral fates in fish and frogs. A widely accepted model of dorsoventral patterning postulates that a morphogenetic BMP activity gradient patterns cell fates along the dorsoventral axis. Recent work in zebrafish suggests that the role of BMP signaling changes over time, with BMPs required for global dorsoventral patterning during early gastrulation and for tail patterning during late gastrulation and early somitogenesis. Key questions remain about the late phase, including which BMP ligands are required and how the functions of BMPs differ during the early and late gastrula stages. In a screen for dominant enhancers of mutations in the homeobox genes vox and vent, which function in parallel to bmp signaling, we identified an insertion mutation in bmp4. We then performed a reverse genetic screen to isolate a null allele of bmp4. We report the characterization of these two alleles and demonstrate that BMP4 is required during the later phase of BMP signaling for the specification of ventroposterior cell fates. Our results indicate that different bmp genes are essential at different stages. In addition, we present genetic evidence supporting a role for a morphogenetic BMP gradient in establishing mesodermal fates during the later phase of BMP signaling.},

The equilibrium distributions for the resulting mix of polygonal types are explored for a range of stochastic rules.

The cell traction force (CTF) is not only essential for cell migration, but it is also used by cells to control their shape and maintain cellular homeostasis. As such, quantification of CTFs aids in better understanding of many fundamental biological processes such as morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and wound healing of tissues and organs. A new technology called cell traction force microscopy (CTFM) has been developed to determine CTFs in a quantitative fashion. The advantage of this technology is that it directly measures the "cause" (i.e., CTFs) of cell movement instead of the "effect" (i.e., cell movement itself), which is measured by various conventional methods. This chapter provides detailed information of materials and methods that are needed in order to perform typical CTFM experiments. Several examples are also given to illustrate various applications of CTFM in cell biology research.},

title = {Phosphoinositide 3-kinase is required for process outgrowth and cell polarization of gastrulating mesendodermal cells},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: During vertebrate gastrulation, cell polarization and migration are core components in the cellular rearrangements that lead to the formation of the three germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Previous studies have implicated the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway in controlling cell morphology and movement during gastrulation. However, cell polarization and directed cell migration are reduced but not completely abolished in the absence of Wnt/PCP signals; this observation indicates that other signaling pathways must be involved.

RESULTS: We show that Phosphoinositide 3-Kinases (PI3Ks) are required at the onset of zebrafish gastrulation in mesendodermal cells for process formation and cell polarization. Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) functions upstream of PI3K, while Protein Kinase B (PKB), a downstream effector of PI3K activity, localizes to the leading edge of migrating mesendodermal cells. In the absence of PI3K activity, PKB localization and cell polarization are strongly reduced in mesendodermal cells and are followed by slower but still highly coordinated and directed movements of these cells.

CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a novel role of a signaling pathway comprised of PDGF, PI3K, and PKB in the control of morphogenetic cell movements during gastrulation. Furthermore, our findings provide insight into the relationship between cell polarization and directed cell migration at the onset of zebrafish gastrulation.},

Work with lineage tracing and fate mapping has shown that the marginal cells of the blastoderm give rise to hypoblast-derived fates (mesoderm and endoderm). However, experiments described here show that these marginal blastoderm cells remain pluripotent and uncommitted throughout the late blastula and early gastrula stages. Embryonic cells become committed to a hypoblast-derived fate at mid-gastrulation. Time-lapse photographic analysis reveals that committed cells, when transplanted heterotopically and heterochronically, can migrate along atypical pathways to reposition themselves within a more correct environment.},

abstract = {The seven-transmembrane protocadherin, Flamingo, functions in a number of processes during Drosophila development, including planar cell polarity (PCP). To assess the role(s) of Flamingo1/Celsr1 (Fmi1) during vertebrate embryogenesis we have exploited the zebrafish system, identifying two Fmi1 orthologues (zFmi1a and zFmi1b) and employing morpholinos to induce mis-splicing of zebrafish fmi1 mRNAs, to both imitate mutations identified in Drosophila flamingo and generate novel aberrant Flamingo proteins. We demonstrate that in the zebrafish gastrula, Fmi1 proteins function in concert with each other and with the vertebrate PCP proteins, Wnt11 and Strabismus, to mediate convergence and extension during gastrulation, without altering early dorso-ventral patterning. We show that zebrafish Fmi1a promotes extension of the entire antero-posterior axis of the zebrafish gastrula including prechordal plate and ventral diencephalic precursors. However, while we show that control over axial extension is autonomous, we find that Fmi1a is not required within lateral cells undergoing dorsal convergence.},

title = {Effective guidance of collective migration based on differences in cell states},
abstract = {Directed cell migration is important for normal animal development and physiology. The process can also be subverted by tumor cells to invade other tissues and to metastasize. Some cells, such as leukocytes, migrate individually; other cells migrate together in groups or sheets, called collective cell migration. Guidance of individually migrating cells depends critically on subcellularly localized perception and transduction of signals. For collective cell migration, guidance could result from cells within a group achieving different signaling levels, with directionality then encoded in the collective rather than in individual cells. Here we subject this collective guidance hypothesis to direct tests, using migration of border cells during Drosophila oogenesis as our model system. These cells normally use two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), PDGF/VEGF-related receptor (PVR) and EGFR, to read guidance cues secreted by the oocyte. Elevated but delocalized RTK signaling in one cell of the cluster was achieved by overexpression of PVR in the absence of ligand or by overexpression of fusion receptors unable to detect Drosophila ligands; alternatively, Rac was photoactivated centrally within a single cell. In each case, one cell within the group was in a high signal state, whereas others were in low signal states. The high signal cell directed cluster movement effectively. We conclude that differences in cell signaling states are sufficient to direct collective migration and are likely a substantial contributor to normal guidance. Cell signaling states could manifest as differences in gene expression or metabolite levels and thus differ substantially from factors normally considered when analyzing eukaryotic cell guidance.},

abstract = {Planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins form polarized cortical domains that govern polarity of external structures such as hairs and cilia in both vertebrate and invertebrate epithelia. The mechanisms that globally orient planar polarity are not understood, and are investigated here in the Drosophila wing using a combination of experiment and theory. Planar polarity arises during growth and PCP domains are initially oriented toward the well-characterized organizer regions that control growth and patterning. At pupal stages, the wing hinge contracts, subjecting wing-blade epithelial cells to anisotropic tension in the proximal-distal axis. This results in precise patterns of oriented cell elongation, cell rearrangement and cell division that elongate the blade proximo-distally and realign planar polarity with the proximal-distal axis. Mutation of the atypical Cadherin Dachsous perturbs the global polarity pattern by altering epithelial dynamics. This mechanism utilizes the cellular movements that sculpt tissues to align planar polarity with tissue shape.},

abstract = {Multiple molecular cues guide neuronal axons to their targets during development. Previous studies in vitro have shown that mechanical stimulation also can affect axon growth; however, whether mechanical force contributes to axon guidance in vivo is unknown. We investigated the role of muscle contractions in the guidance of zebrafish peripheral Rohon-Beard (RB) sensory axons in vivo. We analyzed several mutants that affect muscle contraction through different molecular pathways, including a new mutant allele of the titin a (pik) gene, mutants that affect the hedgehog signaling pathway, and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mutant. We found RB axon defects in these mutants, the severity of which appeared to correlate with the extent of muscle contraction loss. These axons extend between the muscle and skin and normally have ventral trajectories and repel each other on contact. RB peripheral axons in muscle mutants extend longitudinally instead of ventrally, and the axons fail to repel one another on contact. In addition, we showed that limiting muscle movements by embedding embryos in agarose caused similar defects in peripheral RB axon guidance. This work suggests that the mechanical forces generated by muscle contractions are necessary for proper sensory axon pathfinding in vivo.},

title = {Neurulation: coming to closure},
abstract = {Neurulation is a morphogenetic event par excellence. During this highly choreographed four-dimensional process, a flat sheet of ectoderm is transformed into an elongated tubular rudiment, the neural tube, which exhibits rostro-caudal and mediolateral regionalization. Many tissues interact during neurulation to induce and regionalize the neuroectoderm and to produce the morphogenetic forces that drive neurulation. Such forces are generated by fundamental cell behaviors such as changes in cell shape, position and number. In addition, morphoregulatory molecules expressed during neurulation underlie induction and patterning of the forming neuraxis. Despite recent advances in our understanding of neurulation, neural tube defects continue to be a major health care concern. Further research, utilizing a panoply of approaches, is necessary to resolve this issue. Thus, although we are beginning to come to closure in terms of understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for normal neural tube formation, 'coming to closure' is exactly the problem that requires resolution to prevent these devastating birth defects.},

Yet, despite its central role in cell biology, the centrosome is not present in all multicellular organisms or in all cells of a given organism. The main outcome of centrosome reproduction is the transmission of polarity to daughter cells and, in most animal species, the sperm-donated centrosome defines embryo polarity. Here I will discuss the role of the centrosome in cell polarity, resulting from its ability to position the nucleus at the cell center, and discuss how centrosome innovation might have been critical during metazoan evolution.},

title = {3D early embryogenesis image filtering by nonlinear partial differential equations},
abstract = {We present nonlinear diffusion equations, numerical schemes to solve them and their application for filtering 3D images obtained from laser scanning microscopy (LSM) of living zebrafish embryos, with a goal to identify the optimal filtering method and its parameters. In the large scale applications dealing with analysis of 3D+time embryogenesis images, an important objective is a correct detection of the number and position of cell nuclei yielding the spatio-temporal cell lineage tree of embryogenesis. The filtering is the first and necessary step of the image analysis chain and must lead to correct results, removing the noise, sharpening the nuclei edges and correcting the acquisition errors related to spuriously connected subregions. In this paper we study such properties for the regularized Perona-Malik model and for the generalized mean curvature flow equations in the level-set formulation. A comparison with other nonlinear diffusion filters, like tensor anisotropic diffusion and Beltrami flow, is also included. All numerical schemes are based on the same discretization principles, i.e. finite volume method in space and semi-implicit scheme in time, for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. These numerical schemes are unconditionally stable, fast and naturally parallelizable. The filtering results are evaluated and compared first using the Mean Hausdorff distance between a gold standard and different isosurfaces of original and filtered data. Then, the number of isosurface connected components in a region of interest (ROI) detected in original and after the filtering is compared with the corresponding correct number of nuclei in the gold standard. Such analysis proves the robustness and reliability of the edge preserving nonlinear diffusion filtering for this type of data and lead to finding the optimal filtering parameters for the studied models and numerical schemes. Further comparisons consist in ability of splitting the very close objects which are artificially connected due to acquisition error intrinsically linked to physics of LSM. In all studied aspects it turned out that the nonlinear diffusion filter which is called geodesic mean curvature flow (GMCF) has the best performance.},

abstract = {The tissues of a developing embryo are simultaneously patterned, moved and differentiated according to an exchange of information between their constituent cells. We argue that these complex self-organizing phenomena can only be fully understood with quantitative mathematical frameworks that allow specific hypotheses to be formulated and tested. The quantitative and dynamic imaging of growing embryos at the molecular, cellular and tissue level is the key experimental advance required to achieve this interaction between theory and experiment. Here we describe how mathematical modelling has become an invaluable method to integrate quantitative biological information across temporal and spatial scales, serving to connect the activity of regulatory molecules with the morphological development of organisms.},

title = {Optical deformability as an inherent cell marker for testing malignant transformation and metastatic competence},
abstract = {The relationship between the mechanical properties of cells and their molecular architecture has been the focus of extensive research for decades. The cytoskeleton, an internal polymer network, in particular determines a cell's mechanical strength and morphology. This cytoskeleton evolves during the normal differentiation of cells, is involved in many cellular functions, and is characteristically altered in many diseases, including cancer. Here we examine this hypothesized link between function and elasticity, enabling the distinction between different cells, by using a microfluidic optical stretcher, a two-beam laser trap optimized to serially deform single suspended cells by optically induced surface forces. In contrast to previous cell elasticity measurement techniques, statistically relevant numbers of single cells can be measured in rapid succession through microfluidic delivery, without any modification or contact. We find that optical deformability is sensitive enough to monitor the subtle changes during the progression of mouse fibroblasts and human breast epithelial cells from normal to cancerous and even metastatic state. The surprisingly low numbers of cells required for this distinction reflect the tight regulation of the cytoskeleton by the cell. This suggests using optical deformability as an inherent cell marker for basic cell biological investigation and diagnosis of disease.},

title = {mRNA localization patterns in zebrafish oocytes},
abstract = {In both invertebrate and vertebrate systems, the localization of maternal mRNAs is a common mechanism used to influence developmental processes, including the establishment of the dorsal/ventral axis, anterior/posterior axis, and the germ line (for review, see Bashirullah et al., 1998. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 67, 335-394). While the existence of localized maternal mRNAs has been reported in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, the precise localization patterns of these molecules during oogenesis has not been determined. In this study, in situ hybridization experiments were performed on zebrafish ovaries and activated eggs to examine different mRNA localization patterns. The results establish that while some maternal mRNAs remain ubiquitously distributed throughout the oocyte, other mRNAs follow specific localization patterns, including localization to the animal pole, localization to the vegetal pole, and cortical localization. The animal/vegetal axis is first apparent in stage II oocytes when the earliest mRNA localization is seen. Unique patterns of localization are seen in mature eggs as well. Some mRNAs maintain their oocyte localization patterns, while others localize upon egg activation (fertilization).},

abstract = {During gastrulation, the mesoderm spreads out between ectoderm and endoderm to form a mesenchymal cell layer. Surprisingly the underlying principles of mesoderm layer formation are very similar in evolutionarily distant species like the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and the frog, Xenopus laevis, in which the molecular and the cellular basis of mesoderm layer formation have been extensively studied. Complementary expression of growth factors in the ectoderm and their receptors in the mesoderm act to orient cellular protrusive activities and direct cell movement, leading to radial cell intercalation and the spreading of the mesoderm layer. This mechanism is contrasted with generic physical mechanisms of tissue spreading that consider the adhesive and physical properties of the cells and tissues. Both mechanisms need to be integrated to orchestrate mesenchymal morphogenesis.},

title = {Shear modulation of intercellular contact area between two deformable cells colliding under flow},
abstract = {Shear rate has been shown to critically affect the kinetics and receptor specificity of cell-cell interactions. In this study, the collision process between two modeled cells interacting in a linear shear flow is numerically investigated. The two identical biological or artificial cells are modeled as deformable capsules composed of an elastic membrane. The cell deformation and trajectories are computed using the immersed boundary method (IBM) for shear rates of 100-400s(-1). As the two cells collide under hydrodynamic shear, large local cell deformations develop. The effective contact area between the two cells is modulated by the shear rate, and reaches a maximum value at intermediate levels of shear. At relatively low shear rate, the contact area is an enclosed region. As the shear rate increases, dimples form on the membrane surface, and the contact region becomes annular. The nonmonotonic increase of the contact area with the increase of shear rate from computational results implies that there is a maximum effective receptor-ligand binding area for cell adhesion. This finding suggests the existence of possible hydrodynamic mechanism that could be used to interpret the observed maximum leukocyte aggregation in shear flow. The critical shear rate for maximum intercellular contact area is shown to vary with cell properties such as radius and membrane elastic modulus.},

Although gastrulation is known to be regulated by signaling pathways such as the Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway, many questions remain about the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Key factors that may play a role in gastrulation cell movements are cell adhesion and cytoskeletal rearrangement. In addition, some of the driving force for gastrulation may derive from tissue interactions such as those described between the enveloping layer and the yolk syncytial layer.

journal = {BMC developmental biology},
title = {Pre-gastrula expression of zebrafish extraembryonic genes},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many species form extraembryonic tissues during embryogenesis, such as the placenta of humans and other viviparous mammals. Extraembryonic tissues have various roles in protecting, nourishing and patterning embryos. Prior to gastrulation in zebrafish, the yolk syncytial layer - an extraembryonic nuclear syncytium - produces signals that induce mesoderm and endoderm formation. Mesoderm and endoderm precursor cells are situated in the embryonic margin, an external ring of cells along the embryo-yolk interface. The yolk syncytial layer initially forms below the margin, in a domain called the external yolk syncytial layer (E-YSL). RESULTS: We hypothesize that key components of the yolk syncytial layer's mesoderm and endoderm inducing activity are expressed as mRNAs in the E-YSL. To identify genes expressed in the E-YSL, we used microarrays to compare the transcription profiles of intact pre-gastrula embryos with pre-gastrula embryonic cells that we had separated from the yolk and yolk syncytial layer. This identified a cohort of genes with enriched expression in intact embryos. Here we describe our whole mount in situ hybridization analysis of sixty-eight of them. This includes ten genes with E-YSL expression (camsap1l1, gata3, znf503, hnf1ba, slc26a1, slc40a1, gata6, gpr137bb, otop1 and cebpa), four genes with expression in the enveloping layer (EVL), a superficial epithelium that protects the embryo (zgc:136817, zgc:152778, slc14a2 and elovl6l), three EVL genes whose expression is transiently confined to the animal pole (elovl6l, zgc:136359 and clica), and six genes with transient maternal expression (mtf1, wu:fj59f04, mospd2, rftn2, arrdc1a and pho). We also assessed the requirement of Nodal signaling for the expression of selected genes in the E-YSL, EVL and margin. Margin expression was Nodal dependent for all genes we tested, including the concentrated margin expression of an EVL gene: zgc:110712. All other instances of EVL and E-YSL expression that we tested were Nodal independent. CONCLUSION: We have devised an effective strategy for enriching and identifying genes expressed in the E-YSL of pre-gastrula embryos. To our surprise, maternal genes and genes expressed in the EVL were also enriched by this strategy. A number of these genes are promising candidates for future functional studies on early embryonic patterning.},

To augment current neurobiological research, we have developed the first three-dimensional digital atlas of the zebrafish brain from T2-weighted magnetic resonance histology (MRH) images acquired on a 16.4-T superconducting magnet. We achieved an isotropic resolution of 10 microm, which is the highest resolution achieved in a vertebrate brain and, for the first time, is comparable in slice thickness to conventional histology. By using manual segmentation, 53 anatomical structures, including fiber tracts as small as 40 microm, were delineated. Using Amira software, structures were also individually segmented and reconstructed to create three-dimensional animations. Additional quantitative information including, volume, surface areas, and mean gray scale intensities were also determined. Finally, we established a stereotaxic coordinate system as a framework in which maps created from other modalities can be incorporated into the atlas.},

abstract = {Loss of fibronectin (FN) from the cell surface has been shown to be closely associated with malignant transformation of cells. To elucidate the role of the FN matrix in the modulation of malignant phenotypes, we overexpressed a full-length cDNA encoding plasma-type FN in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. The cells overexpressing FN adopted a more flattened morphology and deposited a moderately developed FN matrix both in vitro and in vivo, although the level of expression of integrin alpha5beta1 remained unchanged. FN-overexpressing cells exhibited a reduced cell motility on the substratum and grew poorly when injected s.c. into nude mice. Overexpression of FN also suppressed the ability of the tumor cells to proliferate in soft agar, whereas the suppression was reversed by inclusion in soft agar of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing peptide and adhesion-blocking antibodies against the central cell-binding domain of FN. Neither cell motility nor growth potential was altered by overexpression of a truncated form of FN lacking the central cell-binding domain. These results, taken together, indicate that increased deposition of FN in the pericellular matrix per se can suppress the motility and growth potential of tumor cells through interaction with RGD-recognizing integrins, most likely alpha5beta1.},

abstract = {Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is required for embryonic patterning and postnatal physiology in invertebrates and vertebrates. With the revelation that the primary cilium is crucial for mammalian Hh signaling, the prevailing view that Hh signal transduction mechanisms are conserved across species has been challenged. However, more recent progress on elucidating the function of core Hh pathway cytosolic regulators in Drosophila, zebrafish and mice has confirmed that the essential logic of Hh transduction is similar between species. Here, we review Hh signaling events at the membrane and in the cytosol, and focus on parallel and divergent functions of cytosolic Hh regulators in Drosophila and mammals.},

title = {The ECM moves during primitive streak formation--computation of ECM versus cellular motion},
abstract = {Galileo described the concept of motion relativity--motion with respect to a reference frame--in 1632. He noted that a person below deck would be unable to discern whether the boat was moving. Embryologists, while recognizing that embryonic tissues undergo large-scale deformations, have failed to account for relative motion when analyzing cell motility data. A century of scientific articles has advanced the concept that embryonic cells move ("migrate") in an autonomous fashion such that, as time progresses, the cells and their progeny assemble an embryo. In sharp contrast, the motion of the surrounding extracellular matrix scaffold has been largely ignored/overlooked. We developed computational/optical methods that measure the extent embryonic cells move relative to the extracellular matrix. Our time-lapse data show that epiblastic cells largely move in concert with a sub-epiblastic extracellular matrix during stages 2 and 3 in primitive streak quail embryos. In other words, there is little cellular motion relative to the extracellular matrix scaffold--both components move together as a tissue. The extracellular matrix displacements exhibit bilateral vortical motion, convergence to the midline, and extension along the presumptive vertebral axis--all patterns previously attributed solely to cellular "migration." Our time-resolved data pose new challenges for understanding how extracellular chemical (morphogen) gradients, widely hypothesized to guide cellular trajectories at early gastrulation stages, are maintained in this dynamic extracellular environment. We conclude that models describing primitive streak cellular guidance mechanisms must be able to account for sub-epiblastic extracellular matrix displacements.},

abstract = {E-cadherin is maternally expressed in most vertebrate species, but its function during early development of the vertebrate embryo proper is unknown. To directly examine E-cadherin gene (cdh1) function in zebrafish, morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) that inhibit E-cadherin protein (Cdh1) expression were injected into embryos. Cdh1 knockdown reduced embryo survival. In early cdh1 MO-injected embryos, the cleavage plane orientation between blastomeres was irregular and adhesion defects prevented normal compaction. Cdh1 knockdown inhibited epiboly cell movements. Epiboly delay caused yolk cell lysis and produced embryos with a bifurcated embryonic axis. Cdh1 knockdown inhibited gastrulation cell movements, causing defects in convergence and extension. Additionally, prechordal plate derivatives were absent in Cdh1 knockdown embryos even though presumptive prechordal plate markers were induced normally. E-cadherin mRNA coinjection demonstrated the specificity of cdh1 MO-induced defects. Our experiments illustrate the importance of cdh1 in regulating morphogenetic cell movements and tissue formation in the early embryo.},

title = {SoxB1 transcription factors restrict organizer gene expression by repressing multiple events downstream of Wnt signalling},
abstract = {Formation of the organizer is one of the most central patterning events in vertebrate development. Organizer-derived signals are responsible for establishing the CNS and patterning the dorsal ventral axis. The mechanisms promoting organizer formation are known to involve cooperation between Nodal and Wnt signalling. However, the organizer forms in a very restricted region, suggesting the presence of mechanisms that repress its formation. Here, we show in zebrafish that the transcription factor Sox3 represses multiple steps in the signalling events that lead to organizer formation. Although beta-catenin, Bozozok and Squint are known to play major roles in establishing the dorsal organizer in vertebrate embryos, overexpression of any of these is insufficient to induce robust expression of markers of the organizer in ectopic positions in the animal pole, where Sox3 is strongly expressed. We show that a dominant-negative nuclear localisation mutant of Sox3 can cause ectopic expression of organizer genes via a mechanism that activates all of these earlier factors, resulting in later axis duplication including major bifurcations of the CNS. We also find that the related SoxB1 factor, Sox19b, can act redundantly with Sox3 in these effects. It therefore seems that the broad expression of these SoxB1 genes throughout the early epiblast and their subsequent restriction to the ectoderm is a primary regulator of when and where the organizer forms.},

title = {Maternal induction of ventral fate by zebrafish radar},
abstract = {In vertebrate embryos, maternal determinants are thought to preestablish the dorsoventral axis by locally activating zygotic ventral- and dorsal-specifying genes, e.g., genes encoding bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and BMP inhibitors, respectively. Whereas the canonical Wntbeta-catenin pathway fulfills this role dorsally, the existence of a reciprocal maternal ventralizing signal remains hypothetical. Maternal noncanonical WntCa(2+) signaling may promote ventral fates by suppressing Wntbeta-catenin dorsalizing signals; however, whether any maternal determinant is directly required for the activation of zygotic ventral-specifying genes is unknown. Here, we show that such a function is achieved, in part, in the zebrafish embryo by the maternally encoded transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling molecule, Radar. Loss-of-function experiments, together with epistasis analyses, identify maternal Radar as an upstream activator of bmps expression. Maternal induction of bmps by Radar is essential for zebrafish development as its removal results in larval-lethal dorsalized phenotypes. Double-morphant analyses further suggest that Radar functions through the TGF-beta receptor Alk8 to initiate the expression of bmp genes. Our results support the existence of a previously uncharacterized maternal ventralizing pathway. They might further indicate that maternal TGF-betaRdr and WntCa(2+) pathways complementarily specify ventral cell fates, with the former triggering bmps expression and the latter indirectly repressing genes encoding BMP antagonists.},

abstract = {We have characterized mutations in the early arrest gene, harpy (hrp), and show that they introduce premature stops in the coding region of early mitotic inhibitor1 (Rca1/emi1). In harpy mutants, cells stop dividing during early gastrulation. Lineage analysis confirms that there is little change in cell number after approximately cycle-14. Gross patterning occurs relatively normally, and many organ primordia are produced on time but with smaller numbers of cells. Despite the lack of cell division, some organ systems continue to increase in cell number, suggesting recruitment from surrounding areas. Analysis of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation shows that endoreduplication continues in many cells well past the first day of development, but cells cease endoreduplication once they begin to differentiate and express cell-type markers. Despite relatively normal gross patterning, harpy mutants show several defects in morphogenesis, cell migration and differentiation resulting directly or indirectly from the arrest of cell division.},

title = {Osteogenic transcription factor Runx2 is a maternal determinant of dorsoventral patterning in zebrafish},
abstract = {The maternal genome greatly influences vertebrate embryogenesis before activation of zygotic transcription. Dorsoventral patterning is initiated by maternal factors, but the molecular pathways involved are incompletely understood. In frogs and fish, localized zygotic domains are induced whereby cells either express dorsal or ventral genes. Wnt/beta-catenin signalling promotes expression of the earliest dorsal zygotic genes. Among key zygotic ventralizing factors are the bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps) and the Vent homeodomain family; the latter act as repressors of dorsal organizer gene transcription. Here we show that Runx2, a transcription factor essential for bone formation, is an important maternal determinant of ventral zygotic genes in zebrafish. Depletion of maternal Runx2b type2 strongly dorsalizes embryos, due to loss of the earliest zygotic expression of vox, vent and ved, resulting in expansion of dorsal gene expression. To date, Runx2b is the only known regulator of vox, vent and ved at the onset of zygotic transcription; we show that this regulation is direct. Runx2 transcripts are processed in mature mouse oocytes and we show that murine Runx2 type2 can substitute for the zebrafish orthologue in its ventralizing function, suggesting that Runx2 may have an evolutionarily conserved role in axis formation.},

abstract = {We describe mesendoderm morphogenesis during gastrulation in the frog Xenopus laevis and investigate the mechanics of these movements with tissue explants. When a dorsal marginal zone explant is plated onto fibronectin, the mesendoderm moves away from the dorsal axial tissues as an intact sheet. Mesendodermal cells within these explants display monopolar protrusive activity and radially intercalate during explant extension. Live time-lapse confocal sequences of actin dynamics at the margin of these extending explants prompt us to propose that integrin-mediated traction drives these movements. We demonstrate that integrin alpha(5)beta(1) recognition of the synergy site located within the type III(9) repeat of fibronectin is required for mesendoderm extension. Normal mesendoderm morphogenesis occurs with a unique "cup-shaped" geometry of the extending mesendodermal mantle and coincides with a higher rate of tissue extension than that seen in the simpler dorsal marginal zone explant. These higher rates can be reconstituted with "in-the-round" configurations of several explants. We propose several mechanically based hypotheses to explain both the initial fibronectin-dependent extension of the mesendoderm and additional requirement of tissue geometry during the high-velocity closure of the mesendodermal mantle.},

title = {Xenopus Cdc42 regulates convergent extension movements during gastrulation through Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway},
abstract = {Rho GTPases are molecular switches that regulate many essential cellular processes, including actin dynamics, cell adhesion, cell-cycle progression, and transcription. We have isolated the Xenopus homolog of Rho GTPase Cdc42 and examined its potential role during gastrulation movements in early Xenopus embryos. XCdc42 is expressed in tissues undergoing extensive morphogenetic changes, such as the deep layers of involuting mesoderm and posterior neuroectoderm during gastrulation, and somitic mesoderm at neurula stages. Overexpression of either wild-type (WT) or dominant-negative (DN) XCdc42 interferes with convergent extension movements in intact embryos, activin-stimulated animal caps, and dorsal marginal zone explants. These effects occur without affecting mesodermal specification. Overexpression of WT or DN XCdc42 leads to the decrease and increase of cell adhesiveness of blastomeres, respectively, as demonstrated by the cell adhesion assay. In addition, when overexpressed, PKC-alpha, XWnt-5a, and Mfz-3 inhibit activin-induced convergent extension in animal cap explants. This inhibition can be rescued by coexpression of DN XCdc42, implying that XCdc42 acts downstream of the Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway involving PKC activation. XCdc42 also lies downstream of XWnt-5a in the regulation of Ca2+-dependent cell adhesion. Taken together, our results suggest that XCdc42 plays a role in the regulation of convergent extension movements during gastrulation through the protein kinase C-mediated Wnt/Ca2+ pathway.},

abstract = {The single replacement from milk teeth to permanent teeth makes mammalian teeth different from teeth of most nonmammalian vertebrates and other epithelial organs such as hair and feathers, whose continuous replacement has been linked to Wnt signaling. Here we show that mouse tooth buds expressing stabilized beta-catenin in epithelium give rise to dozens of teeth. The molar crowns, however, are typically simplified unicusped cones. We demonstrate that the supernumerary teeth develop by a renewal process where new signaling centers, the enamel knots, bud off from the existing dental epithelium. The basic aspects of the unlocked tooth renewal can be reproduced with a computer model on tooth development by increasing the intrinsic level of activator production, supporting the role of beta-catenin pathway as an upstream activator of enamel knot formation. These results may implicate Wnt signaling in tooth renewal, a capacity that was all but lost when mammals evolved progressively more complicated tooth shapes.},

Differential migratory behavior within the heart field was observed, resulting in a rotation of the heart tube. The leftward displacement and rotation of the tube requires hyaluronan synthase 2 expression within the CPCs. Furthermore, by reducing or ectopically activating BMP signaling or by implantation of BMP beads we could demonstrate that BMP signaling, which is asymmetrically activated in the lateral plate mesoderm and regulated by early left-right signals, is required to direct CPC migration and cardiac rotation. Together, these results support a model in which CPCs migrate toward a BMP source during development of the linear heart tube, providing a mechanism by which the left-right axis drives asymmetric development of the vertebrate heart.},

title = {Planar cell polarity signalling couples cell division and morphogenesis during neurulation},
abstract = {Environmental and genetic aberrations lead to neural tube closure defects (NTDs) in 1 out of every 1,000 births. Mouse and frog models for these birth defects have indicated that Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2, also known as Strabismus) and other components of planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling might control neurulation by promoting the convergence of neural progenitors to the midline. Here we show a novel role for PCP signalling during neurulation in zebrafish. We demonstrate that non-canonical Wnt/PCP signalling polarizes neural progenitors along the anteroposterior axis. This polarity is transiently lost during cell division in the neural keel but is re-established as daughter cells reintegrate into the neuroepithelium. Loss of zebrafish Vangl2 (in trilobite mutants) abolishes the polarization of neural keel cells, disrupts re-intercalation of daughter cells into the neuroepithelium, and results in ectopic neural progenitor accumulations and NTDs. Remarkably, blocking cell division leads to rescue of trilobite neural tube morphogenesis despite persistent defects in convergence and extension. These results reveal a function for PCP signalling in coupling cell division and morphogenesis at neurulation and indicate a previously unrecognized mechanism that might underlie NTDs.},

title = {Zebrafish neural tube morphogenesis requires Scribble-dependent oriented cell divisions},
abstract = {How control of subcellular events in single cells determines morphogenesis on the scale of the tissue is largely unresolved. The stereotyped cross-midline mitoses of progenitors in the zebrafish neural keel provide a unique experimental paradigm for defining the role and control of single-cell orientation for tissue-level morphogenesis in vivo. We show here that the coordinated orientation of individual progenitor cell division in the neural keel is the cellular determinant required for morphogenesis into a neural tube epithelium with a single straight lumen. We find that Scribble is required for oriented cell division and that its function in this process is independent of canonical apicobasal and planar polarity pathways. We identify a role for Scribble in controlling clustering of α-catenin foci in dividing progenitors. Loss of either Scrib or N-cadherin results in abnormally oriented mitoses, reduced cross-midline cell divisions, and similar neural tube defects. We propose that Scribble-dependent nascent cell-cell adhesion clusters between neuroepithelial progenitors contribute to define orientation of their cell division. Finally, our data demonstrate that while oriented mitoses of individual cells determine neural tube architecture, the tissue can in turn feed back on its constituent cells to define their polarization and cell division orientation to ensure robust tissue morphogenesis.},

title = {Developmental constraints vs. variational properties: How pattern formation can help to understand evolution and development},
abstract = {This article suggests that apparent disagreements between the concept of developmental constraints and neo-Darwinian views on morphological evolution can disappear by using a different conceptualization of the interplay between development and selection. A theoretical framework based on current evolutionary and developmental biology and the concepts of variational properties, developmental patterns and developmental mechanisms is presented. In contrast with existing paradigms, the approach in this article is specifically developed to compare developmental mechanisms by the morphological variation they produce and the way in which their functioning can change due to genetic variation. A developmental mechanism is a gene network, which is able to produce patterns in space though the regulation of some cell behaviour (like signalling, mitosis, apoptosis, adhesion, etc.). The variational properties of a developmental mechanism are all the pattern transformations produced under different initial and environmental conditions or IS-mutations. IS-mutations are DNA changes that affect how two genes in a network interact, while T-mutations are mutations that affect the topology of the network itself. This article explains how this new framework allows predictions not only about how pattern formation affects variation, and thus phenotypic evolution, but also about how development evolves by replacement between pattern formation mechanisms. This article presents testable inferences about the evolution of the structure of development and the phenotype under different selective pressures. That is what kind of pattern formation mechanisms, in which relative temporal order, and which kind of phenotypic changes, are expected to be found in development.},

title = {A 90-degree rotation of the mitotic spindle changes the orientation of mitoses of zebrafish neuroepithelial cells},
abstract = {In the neural plate and neural tube in the trunk region of the zebrafish embryo, dividing cells are oriented parallel to the plane of the neuroepithelium, while in neural keel/rod, cells divide perpendicular to it. This change in the orientation of mitosis is brought about by a 90 degrees rotation of the mitotic spindle. As the two halves of the neural primordium in keel/rod stage are in apposition, the perpendicular orientation of mitoses in this stage determines that daughter cells become allocated to both sides of the neural tube. To assess the role played by cell junctions in controlling the orientation of dividing cells, we studied the expression of components of adherens and tight junctions in the neuroepithelial cells. We find that these proteins are distributed irregularly at the neural plate stage and become polarised apically in the cell membrane only during the keel/rod stage. The stereotypic orientation of mitoses is perturbed only weakly upon loss of function of the cell junction components ASIP and aPKClambda, suggesting that mitotic orientation depends in part on the integrity of cell junctions and the polarity of the epithelium as a whole. However, the 90-degree rotation of the spindle does not require perfectly polarised cell junctions between the neuroepithelial cells.},

Biologically realistic modeling is needed to test hypotheses about the mechanisms that govern these signals and how nervous system function emerges from the operation of these mechanisms. The NEURON simulation program provides a powerful and flexible environment for implementing such models of individual neurons and small networks of neurons. It is particularly useful when membrane potential is nonuniform and membrane currents are complex. We present the basic ideas that would help informed users make the most efficient use of NEURON.},

title = {Varying environments can speed up evolution},
abstract = {Simulations of biological evolution, in which computers are used to evolve systems toward a goal, often require many generations to achieve even simple goals. It is therefore of interest to look for generic ways, compatible with natural conditions, in which evolution in simulations can be speeded. Here, we study the impact of temporally varying goals on the speed of evolution, defined as the number of generations needed for an initially random population to achieve a given goal. Using computer simulations, we find that evolution toward goals that change over time can, in certain cases, dramatically speed up evolution compared with evolution toward a fixed goal. The highest speedup is found under modularly varying goals, in which goals change over time such that each new goal shares some of the subproblems with the previous goal. The speedup increases with the complexity of the goal: the harder the problem, the larger the speedup. Modularly varying goals seem to push populations away from local fitness maxima, and guide them toward evolvable and modular solutions. This study suggests that varying environments might significantly contribute to the speed of natural evolution. In addition, it suggests a way to accelerate optimization algorithms and improve evolutionary approaches in engineering.},

abstract = {Cell generated contractility is a major driver of morphogenesis during processes such as epithelial bending and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions. Previous studies of contraction in embryos have relied on developmentally programmed cell shape changes such as those that accompany ventral furrow formation in Drosophila, bottle cell formation in Xenopus, ingression in amniote embryos, and neurulation in vertebrate embryos. We have identified three methods to reproducibly and acutely induce contraction in embryonic epithelial sheets: laser activation, electrical stimulation, and nano-perfusion with chemicals released by wounding. Contractions induced by all three methods occur over a similar time-scale (1 to 2 min) and lead to reorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton. By combining induced contractions with micro-aspiration we can simultaneously measure the stiffness of the tissue and the force and work done by contractions. Laser activation allows real-time visualization of F-actin remodeling during contraction. Perfusion with cell lysate suggests that these three stimuli activate physiologically relevant pathways that maintain epithelial tension or trigger epithelial morphogenesis. Our methods provide the means to control and study cellular contractility and will allow dissection of molecular mechanisms and biomechanics of cellular contractility.},

title = {Computational Model for Migration of a Cell Cluster in Three-Dimensional Matrices},
abstract = {This paper presents a first forced-based dynamics computer model of a cell cluster moving collectively in a 3D environment mimicking the extracellular matrix. In general, collective cell migration is a relevant part of the mechanisms for tissue repair, morphogenesis, and cancer invasion. Particularly in cancer, invasion occurs through multicellular 3D strands as well as collective cell clusters. Because cancer is a slow process, these clusters have not been carefully observed. However, the prevalence of this mechanism of cell locomotion makes it a target for study. Due to the different molecular mechanisms involved in this movement and the complex relations among them, a computer model would be of great use. The model presented here takes into account ligand concentration, matrix metalloproteinase activity, and cluster geometry based on experimental findings and experimentally validated single cell computer models; thus incorporating implicitly different underlying molecular properties. The velocity profiles of the cell clusters were recorded and analyzed. In particular seven different profiles are observed based on different participation of ligands, proteinases, and mechanical forces involved. The model is successful in showing potential effects of altering single variables in a system of cells in motion. Special emphasis is made on future directions for improvement and the variables to be potentially modulated to simulate particular physiological conditions.},

title = {Tooth morphogenesis in vivo, in vitro, and in silico},
abstract = {One of the aims of developmental biology is to understand how a single egg cell gives rise to the complex spatial distributions of cell types and extracellular components of the adult phenotype. This review discusses the main genetic and epigenetic interactions known to play a role in tooth development and how they can be integrated into coherent models. Along the same lines, several hypotheses about aspects of tooth development that are currently not well understood are evaluated. This is done from their morphological consequences from the model and how these fit known morphological variation and change during tooth development. Thus the aim of this review is two-fold. On one hand the model and its comparison with experimental evidence will be used to outline our current understanding about tooth morphogenesis. On the other hand these same comparisons will be used to introduce a computational model that makes accurate predictions on three-dimensional morphology and patterns of gene expression by implementing cell signaling, proliferation and mechanical interactions between cells. In comparison with many other models of development this model includes reaction-diffusion-like dynamics confined to a diffusion chamber (the developing tooth) that changes in shape in three-dimensions over time. These changes are due to mechanical interactions between cells triggered by the proliferation enhancing effect of the reactants (growth factors). In general, tooth morphogenesis can be understood from the indirect cross-regulation between extracellular signals, the local regulation of proliferation and differentiation rates by these signals and the effect of intermediate developing morphology on the diffusion, dilution, and spatial distribution of these signals. Overall, this review should be interesting to either readers interested in the mechanistic bases of tooth morphogenesis, without necessarily being interested in modeling per se, and readers interested in development modeling in general.},

title = {Models of biological pattern formation: from elementary steps to the organization of embryonic axes},
abstract = {An inroad into an understanding of the complex molecular interactions on which development is based can be achieved by uncovering the minimum requirements that describe elementary steps and their linkage. Organizing regions and other signaling centers can be generated by reactions that involve local self-enhancement coupled to antagonistic reactions of longer range. More complex patterns result from a chaining of such reactions in which one pattern generates the prerequisites for the next. Patterning along the single axis of radial symmetric animals including the small freshwater polyp hydra can be explained in this way. The body pattern of such ancestral organisms evolved into the brain of higher organisms, while trunk and midline formation are later evolutionary additions. The equivalent of the hydra organizer is the blastopore, for instance, the marginal zone in amphibians. It organizes the anteroposterior axis. The Spemann organizer, located on this primary organizer, initiates and elongates the midline, which is responsible for the dorsoventral pattern. In contrast, midline formation in insects is achieved by an inhibitory signal from a dorsal organizer that restricts the midline to the ventral side. Thus, different modes of midline formation are proposed to be the points of no return in the separation of phyla. The conversion of the transient patterns of morphogenetic signaling into patterns of stable gene activation can be achieved by genes whose gene products have a positive feedback on the activity of their own gene. If several such autoregulatory genes mutually exclude each other, a cell has to make an unequivocal decision to take a particular pathway. Under the influence of a gradient, sharply confined regions with particular determinations can emerge. Borders between regions of different gene activities, and the areas of intersection of two such borders, become the new signaling centers that initiate secondary embryonic fields. As required for leg and wing formation, these new fields emerge in pairs at defined positions, with defined orientation and left-right handedness. Recent molecular-genetic results provide strong support for theoretically predicted interactions. By computer simulations it is shown that the regulatory properties of these models correspond closely to experimental observations (animated simulations are available at www.eb.tuebingen.mpg.de/meinhardt).},

title = {Gastrulation dynamics: cells move into focus},
abstract = {During vertebrate gastrulation, a relatively limited number of blastodermal cells undergoes a stereotypical set of cellular movements that leads to formation of the three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. Gastrulation, therefore, provides a unique developmental system in which to study cell movements in vivo in a fairly simple cellular context. Recent advances have been made in elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie cell movements during zebrafish gastrulation. These findings can be compared with observations made in other model systems to identify potential general mechanisms of cell migration during development.},

title = {Specification of cell fates at the dorsal margin of the zebrafish gastrula},
abstract = {Using fate mapping techniques, we have analyzed development of cells of the dorsal marginal region in wild-type and mutant zebrafish. We define a domain in the early gastrula that is located just at the margin and centered on the dorsal midline, in which most cells generate clones that develop exclusively as notochord. The borders of the notochord domain are sharp at the level of single cells, and coincide almost exactly with the border of the expression domain of the homeobox gene floating head (flh; zebrafish homologue of Xnot), a gene essential for notochord development. In flh mutants, cells in the notochord domain generate clones of muscle cells. In contrast, notochord domain cells form mesenchyme in embryos mutant for no tail (ntl; zebrafish homologue of Brachyury). A minority of cells in the notochord domain in wild-type embryos develop as unrestricted mesoderm, invariably located in the tail, suggesting that early gastrula expression of flh does not restrict cellular potential to the notochord fate. The unrestricted tail mesodermal fate is also expressed by the forerunner cells, a cluster of cells located outside the blastoderm, adjacent to the notochord domain. We show that cells can leave the dorsal blastoderm to join the forerunners, suggesting that relocation between fate map domains might respecify notochord domain cells to the tail mesodermal fate. An intermediate fate of the forerunners is to form the epithelial lining of Kupffer's vesicle, a transient structure of the teleost tailbud. The forerunners appear to generate the entire structure of Kupffer's vesicle, which also develops in most flh mutants. Although forerunner cells are present in ntl mutants, Kupffer's vesicle never appears, which is correlated with the later severe disruption of tail development.},

abstract = {Oriented cell division is an integral part of pattern development in processes ranging from asymmetric segregation of cell-fate determinants to the shaping of tissues. Despite proposals that it has an important function in tissue elongation, the mechanisms regulating division orientation have been little studied outside of the invertebrates Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we have analysed mitotic divisions during zebrafish gastrulation using in vivo confocal imaging and found that cells in dorsal tissues preferentially divide along the animal-vegetal axis of the embryo. Establishment of this animal-vegetal polarity requires the Wnt pathway components Silberblick/Wnt11, Dishevelled and Strabismus. Our findings demonstrate an important role for non-canonical Wnt signalling in oriented cell division during zebrafish gastrulation, and indicate that oriented cell division is a driving force for axis elongation. Furthermore, we propose that non-canonical Wnt signalling has a conserved role in vertebrate axis elongation, orienting both cell intercalation and mitotic division.},

abstract = {Histone variants and their modification have significant roles in many cellular processes. In this study, we identified and characterized the histone H2A variant h2af1o in fish and revealed its oocyte-specific expression pattern during oogenesis and embryogenesis. Moreover, posttranslational modification of H2af1o was observed that results from phosphorylation during oocyte maturation. To understand the binding dynamics of the novel core histone variant H2af1o in nucleosomes, we cloned ubiquitous gibel carp h2afx as a conventional histone control and investigated the dynamic exchange difference in chromatin by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. H2af1o has significantly higher mobility in nucleosomes than ubiquitous H2afx. Compared with ubiquitous H2afx, H2af1o has a tightly binding C-terminal and a weakly binding N-terminal. These data indicate that fish oocytes have a novel H2A variant that destabilizes nucleosomes by protruding its N-terminal tail and stabilizes core particles by contracting its C-terminal tail. Our findings suggest that H2af1o may have intrinsic ability to modify chromatin properties during fish oogenesis, oocyte maturation, and early cleavage.},

title = {Mesodermal Wnt signaling organizes the neural plate via Meis3},
abstract = {In vertebrates, canonical Wnt signaling controls posterior neural cell lineage specification. Although Wnt signaling to the neural plate is sufficient for posterior identity, the source and timing of this activity remain uncertain. Furthermore, crucial molecular targets of this activity have not been defined. Here, we identify the endogenous Wnt activity and its role in controlling an essential downstream transcription factor, Meis3. Wnt3a is expressed in a specialized mesodermal domain, the paraxial dorsolateral mesoderm, which signals to overlying neuroectoderm. Loss of zygotic Wnt3a in this region does not alter mesoderm cell fates, but blocks Meis3 expression in the neuroectoderm, triggering the loss of posterior neural fates. Ectopic Meis3 protein expression is sufficient to rescue this phenotype. Moreover, Wnt3a induction of the posterior nervous system requires functional Meis3 in the neural plate. Using ChIP and promoter analysis, we show that Meis3 is a direct target of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. This suggests a new model for neural anteroposterior patterning, in which Wnt3a from the paraxial mesoderm induces posterior cell fates via direct activation of a crucial transcription factor in the overlying neural plate.},

title = {Snail1a and Snail1b cooperate in the anterior migration of the axial mesendoderm in the zebrafish embryo},
abstract = {The Snail genes are implicated in processes that involve cell movement, both during embryonic development and tumour progression. In teleosts, the vertebrate Snail1 gene is represented by two distinct genes, snail1a and snail1b (previously snail1 and snail2). These genes are expressed in complementary mesodermal domains and their combined expression matches that of their mammalian counterpart. By analysing their loss and gain of function, we found that the most-anterior axial mesendodermal cells, the precursors of the polster, move in a cohesive manner directed by the activity of snail1a- and snail1b-expressing cells surrounding these precursors. The cell-autonomous function of Snail1 proteins regulates cell motility and influences the behaviour of Snail-negative neighbouring cells. Snail1a is required by the prechordal plate for it to reach its normal position, whereas Snail1b controls the acquisition of its normal shape. These non-redundant functions of Snail1a and Snail1b in controlling axial mesendoderm migration comply with the duplication-degeneration-complementation model, and indicate that Snail genes not only act as inducers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, but also as more general regulators of cell adhesion and movement.},

An evolutionarily conserved planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling system employs intra- and intercellular feedback interactions between its core components, including Frizzled, Van Gogh, Flamingo, Prickle, and Dishevelled, to establish their characteristic asymmetric intracellular distributions and coordinate planar polarity of cell populations. By translating global patterning information into asymmetries of cell membranes and intracellular organelles, PCP signaling coordinates morphogenetic behaviors of individual cells and cell populations with the embryonic polarity. In vertebrates, by polarizing cilia in the node/Kupffer's vesicle, PCP signaling links the anteroposterior to left-right embryonic polarity.},

title = {Comparison and calibration of different reporters for quantitative analysis of gene expression},
abstract = {Absolute levels of gene expression in bacteria are observed to vary over as much as six orders of magnitude. Thermodynamic models have been proposed as a tool to describe the expression levels of a given transcriptional circuit. In this context, it is essential to understand both the limitations and linear range of the different methods for measuring gene expression and to determine to what extent measurements from different reporters can be directly compared with one aim being the stringent testing of theoretical descriptions of gene expression. In this article, we compare two protein reporters by measuring both the absolute level of expression and fold-change in expression using the fluorescent protein EYFP and the enzymatic reporter β-galactosidase. We determine their dynamic and linear range and show that they are interchangeable for measuring mean levels of expression over four orders of magnitude. By calibrating these reporters such that they can be interpreted in terms of absolute molecular counts, we establish limits for their applicability: autofluorescence on the lower end of expression for EYFP (at ∼10 molecules per cell) and interference with cellular growth on the high end for β-galactosidase (at ∼20,000 molecules per cell). These qualities make the reporters complementary and necessary when trying to experimentally verify the predictions from the theoretical models.},

title = {Wnt11 functions in gastrulation by controlling cell cohesion through Rab5c and E-cadherin},
abstract = {Wnt11 plays a central role in tissue morphogenesis during vertebrate gastrulation, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which Wnt11 exerts its effects remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Wnt11 functions during zebrafish gastrulation by regulating the cohesion of mesodermal and endodermal (mesendodermal) progenitor cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that Wnt11 activity in this process is mediated by the GTPase Rab5, a key regulator of early endocytosis, as blocking Rab5c activity in wild-type embryos phenocopies slb/wnt11 mutants, and enhancing Rab5c activity in slb/wnt11 mutant embryos rescues the mutant phenotype. In addition, we find that Wnt11 and Rab5c control the endocytosis of E-cadherin and are required in mesendodermal cells for E-cadherin-mediated cell cohesion. Together, our results suggest that Wnt11 controls tissue morphogenesis by modulating E-cadherin-mediated cell cohesion through Rab5c, a novel mechanism of Wnt signaling in gastrulation.},

abstract = {Cell motility and matrix assembly have traditionally been studied in isolation because of a lack of suitable model systems in which both can be observed simultaneously. With embryonic tissues from the gastrulating frog Xenopus laevis we observe stages of fibronectin fibrillogenesis coincident with protrusive activity in the overlying cells. Using live confocal time-lapse images collected from Cy3-tagged fibronectin and plasma membrane tethered green fluorescent protein, we describe the movement and the elaboration of a complex fibrillar network undergoing topological rearrangements of fibrils on the surface of an embryonic tissue. Discrete processes of annealing, polymerization, stretching, breaking, and recoiling are recorded. Elaboration and maintenance of the complex topology of the extracellular matrix appears to require filamentous actin. These findings support a mechanical-model in which cell tractive forces elaborate the complex topological fibrillar network and are part of a homeostatic mechanism for the regulation of the extracellular matrix.},

Furthermore, because cells at the boundary often take on important signalling functions by acting as organizing centres, boundary shape and integrity can also control the outcome of many downstream patterning events. Recent experimental findings and theoretical descriptions have shed new light on classic questions about boundaries. In particular, in the past couple of years the role of forces acting in epithelial tissues to maintain boundaries has emerged as a new principle in understanding how early pattern is made into permanent anatomy.},

title = {The apoptotic regulator Nrz controls cytoskeletal dynamics via the regulation of Ca2+ trafficking in the zebrafish blastula},
abstract = {Bcl-2 family members are key regulators of apoptosis. Their involvement in other cellular processes has been so far overlooked. We have studied the role of the Bcl-2 homolog Nrz in the developing zebrafish. Nrz was found to be localized to the yolk syncytial layer, a region containing numerous mitochondria and ER membranes. Nrz knockdown resulted in developmental arrest before gastrulation, due to free Ca(2+) increase in the yolk cell, activating myosin light chain kinase, which led to premature contraction of actin-myosin cables in the margin and separation of the blastomeres from the yolk cell. In the yolk syncytial layer, Nrz appears to prevent the release of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum by directly interacting with the IP3R1 Ca(2+) channel. Thus, the Bcl-2 family may participate in early development, not only by controlling apoptosis but also by acting on cytoskeletal dynamics and cell movements via Ca(2+) fluxes inside the embryo.},

title = {PDGF signalling is required for gastrulation of Xenopus laevis},
abstract = {During Xenopus gastrulation, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor-alpha is expressed in involuting marginal zone cells which migrate over ectodermal cells expressing PDGF-A. To investigate the role of PDGF signalling during this process, we have generated a novel point mutant of PDGF receptor-alpha analogous to the W37 mutation of c-kit. This molecule is a specific, potent, dominant inhibitor of PDGF signalling in vivo. Injection of RNA encoding this protein into Xenopus embryos prevents closure of the blastopore, leads to abnormal gastrulation and a loss of anterior structures. Convergent extension is not inhibited in these embryos, but rather, involuting mesodermal cells fail to adhere to the overlying ectoderm. PDGF may therefore be required for mesodermal cell-substratum interaction.},

title = {Wnt/PCP signaling controls intracellular position of MTOCs during gastrulation convergence and extension movements},
abstract = {During vertebrate gastrulation, convergence and extension cell movements are coordinated with the anteroposterior and mediolateral embryonic axes. Wnt planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP) signaling polarizes the motile behaviors of cells with respect to the anteroposterior embryonic axis. Understanding how Wnt/PCP signaling mediates convergence and extension (C{\&}E) movements requires analysis of the mechanisms employed to alter cell morphology and behavior with respect to embryonic polarity. Here, we examine the interactions between the microtubule cytoskeleton and Wnt/PCP signaling during zebrafish gastrulation. First, we assessed the location of the centrosome/microtubule organizing center (MTOC) relative to the cell nucleus and the body axes, as a marker of cell polarity. The intracellular position of MTOCs was polarized, perpendicular to the plane of the germ layers, independently of Wnt/PCP signaling. In addition, this position became biased posteriorly and medially within the plane of the germ layers at the transition from mid- to late gastrulation and from slow to fast C{\&}E movements. This depends on intact Wnt/PCP signaling through Knypek (Glypican4/6) and Dishevelled components. Second, we tested whether microtubules are required for planar cell polarization. Once the planar cell polarity is established, microtubules are not required for accumulation of Prickle at the anterior cell edge. However, microtubules are needed for cell-cell contacts and initiation of its anterior localization. Reciprocal interactions occur between Wnt/PCP signaling and microtubule cytoskeleton during C{\&}E gastrulation movements. Wnt/PCP signaling influences the polarity of the microtubule cytoskeleton and, conversely, microtubules are required for the asymmetric distribution of Wnt/PCP pathway components.},

title = {On the modelling of biological patterns with mechanochemical models: Insights from analysis and computation},
abstract = {The diversity of biological form is generated by a relatively small number of underlying mechanisms. Consequently, mathematical and computational modelling can, and does, provide insight into how cellular level interactions ultimately give rise to higher level structure. Given cells respond to mechanical stimuli, it is therefore important to consider the effects of these responses within biological self-organisation models. Here, we consider the self-organisation properties of a mechanochemical model previously developed by three of the authors in Acta Biomater. 4, 613-621 (2008), which is capable of reproducing the behaviour of a population of cells cultured on an elastic substrate in response to a variety of stimuli. In particular, we examine the conditions under which stable spatial patterns can emerge with this model, focusing on the influence of mechanical stimuli and the interplay of non-local phenomena. To this end, we have performed a linear stability analysis and numerical simulations based on a mixed finite element formulation, which have allowed us to study the dynamical behaviour of the system in terms of the qualitative shape of the dispersion relation. We show that the consideration of mechanotaxis, namely changes in migration speeds and directions in response to mechanical stimuli alters the conditions for pattern formation in a singular manner. Furthermore without non-local effects, responses to mechanical stimuli are observed to result in dispersion relations with positive growth rates at arbitrarily large wavenumbers, in turn yielding heterogeneity at the cellular level in model predictions. This highlights the sensitivity and necessity of non-local effects in mechanically influenced biological pattern formation models and the ultimate failure of the continuum approximation in their absence.},

abstract = {The earliest stages of embryonic development in all animals examined rely on maternal gene products that are generated during oogenesis and supplied to the egg. The period of maternal control of embryonic development varies among animals according to the onset of zygotic transcription and the persistence of maternal gene products. This maternal regulation has been little studied in vertebrates, owing to the difficulty in manipulating maternal gene function and lack of basic molecular information. However, recent maternal-effect screens in the zebrafish have generated more than 40 unique mutants that are providing new molecular entry points to the maternal control of early vertebrate development. Here we discuss recent studies of 12 zebrafish mutant genes that illuminate the maternal molecular controls on embryonic development, including advances in the regulation of animal-vegetal polarity, egg activation, cleavage development, body plan formation, tissue morphogenesis, microRNA function and germ cell development.},

abstract = {Pou5f1/Oct4 is a transcription factor required for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells in mammals. Zebrafish pou5f1 deficient maternal and zygotic spiel ohne grenzen (MZspg) mutant embryos develop severe gastrulation defects, are dorsalized, and defective in endoderm formation. Here we analyze in detail gastrulation defects, which are manifested by a severe delay in epiboly progression. All three embryonic lineages in MZspg embryos behave abnormally during epiboly: the yolk cell forms an altered array of cortical microtubules and F-Actin, with large patches of microtubule free areas; the enveloping layer (EVL) is delayed in the coordinated cell shape changes of marginal cells, that may be mediated by F-Actin; the deep layer cells (DEL), forming the embryo proper, are non-autonomously affected in their motility and do not enter the space opening by epiboly of the EVL. Analysis of adhesiveness as well as high resolution in vivo time lapse image analysis of DEL cells suggests changed adhesive properties and inability to migrate properly on EVL and yolk syncytial layer (YSL) surfaces. Our data further reveal that during epiboly the EVL may actively probe the YSL by filopodia formation, rather than just being passively pulled vegetalwards. Our findings on the effect of Pou5f1 on cell behavior may be relevant to understand stem cell behavior and tumorigenesis involving Pou5f1.},

title = {Determination of mechanical stress distribution in Drosophila wing discs using photoelasticity},
abstract = {Morphogenesis, the process by which all complex biological structures are formed, is driven by an intricate interplay between genes, growth, as well as intra- and intercellular forces. While the expression of different genes changes the mechanical properties and shapes of cells, growth exerts forces in response to which tissues, organs and more complex structures are shaped. This is exemplified by a number of recent findings for instance in meristem formation in Arabidopsis and tracheal tube formation in Drosophila. However, growth not only generates forces, mechanical forces can also have an effect on growth rates, as is seen in mammalian tissues or bone growth. In fact, mechanical forces can influence the expression levels of patterning genes, allowing control of morphogenesis via mechanical feedback. In order to study the connections between mechanical stress, growth control and morphogenesis, information about the distribution of stress in a tissue is invaluable. Here, we applied stress-birefringence to the wing imaginal disc of Drosophila melanogaster, a commonly used model system for organ growth and patterning, in order to assess the stress distribution present in this tissue. For this purpose, stress-related differences in retardance are measured using a custom-built optical set-up. Applying this method, we found that the stresses are inhomogeneously distributed in the wing disc, with maximum compression in the centre of the wing pouch. This compression increases with wing disc size, showing that mechanical forces vary with the age of the tissue. These results are discussed in light of recent models proposing mechanical regulation of wing disc growth.},

abstract = {Transcription factors have diverse roles during embryonic development, combinatorially controlling cellular states in a spatially and temporally defined manner. Resolving the dynamic transcriptional profiles that underlie these patterning processes is essential for understanding embryogenesis at the molecular level. Here we show how temporal, tissue-specific changes in embryonic transcription factor function can be discerned by integrating caged morpholino oligonucleotides with photoactivatable fluorophores, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and microarray technologies. As a proof of principle, we have dynamically profiled No tail a (Ntla)-dependent genes at different stages of axial mesoderm development in zebrafish, discovering discrete sets of transcripts that are coincident with either notochord cell fate commitment or differentiation. Our studies reveal new regulators of notochord development and the sequential activation of distinct transcriptomes within a cell lineage by a single transcriptional factor and demonstrate how optically controlled chemical tools can dissect developmental processes with spatiotemporal precision.},

title = {Segment number and axial identity in a segmentation clock period mutant},
abstract = {A species-specific number of segments is a hallmark of the vertebrate body plan. The first segmental structures in the vertebrate embryo are the somites, which bud sequentially from the growing presomitic mesoderm (PSM). The Clock and Wavefront model for somitogenesis proposes that the total number of somites is determined by the period of an oscillator or clock operating in the PSM and the total duration of PSM growth. Furthermore, the number of oscillations of the segmentation clock has been suggested to regulate the regional identity of segments along the body axis. Here we test these two ideas in a zebrafish mutant in which the segmentation clock is specifically slowed. This reduces segment number as predicted, but hox gene expression and posterior anatomical markers align with lower segmental counts in mutants compared to the wild-type, arguing against an instructive role of the segmentation clock in determining axial identities. Our data therefore suggest that precise control of segmentation clock period in relation to axial growth ensures a species-specific segment number and that during evolution modulating the clock's period through genetic mutations may have been a relevant way to vary segment number independently of axial regionalization.},

abstract = {Recent debates about model organisms echo far into the past; taking a longer view adds perspective to present concerns. The major approaches in the history of research on vertebrate embryos have tended to exploit different species, though there are long-term continuities too. Early nineteenth-century embryologists worked on surrogates for humans and began to explore the range of vertebrate embryogenesis; late nineteenth-century Darwinists hunted exotic ontogenies; around 1900 experimentalists favored living embryos in which they could easily intervene; reproductive scientists tackled farm animals and human beings; after World War II developmental biologists increasingly engineered species for laboratory life; and proponents of evo-devo have recently challenged the resulting dominance of a few models. Decisions about species have depended on research questions, biological properties, supply lines, and, not least, on methods. Nor are species simply chosen; embryology has transformed them even as they have profoundly shaped the science.},

abstract = {Vertebrate lung has tree-like structure which facilitates gas exchange. After discovery of the involvement of several key toolkit genes--FGF10, BMP4, and Shh, huge amount of molecular information on lung development is now available. However, how their interactions result in a branched structure has not been elucidated. Recently, some studies have utilized mathematical models to understand the mechanism of branching morphogenesis, and we now have some models which are reliable enough to make experimental predictions in the in vitro system. In addition, a different type of modeling, which generates tree-like branching pattern by repeatedly applying a set of simple rules iteratively, is also utilized to model lung function. In this review, I focus on how these models can contribute to understand pattern formation phenomena from experimental biologist's point of view.},

abstract = {Chemotaxis refers to the ability of cells to sense the direction of external chemical gradients and respond by migrating towards the source. A thorough understanding of the chemotactic response of amoebae and neutrophils requires careful quantification of the cell shape changes observed during cell movement. The stochastic nature of this response calls for a statistical characterization of cellular morphology and this requires the processing of large data sets. For this reason, automatic image analysis algorithms are highly desirable and are becoming increasingly available. These usually include a combination of techniques from image segmentation, morphological transformations, as well as the incorporation of numerical algorithms and physical models. Here we review recent developments in the tracking and understanding of motile chemotaxing cells, with a particular emphasis on the description of pseudopodial activity in chemotactic Dictyostelium cells.},

abstract = {The regulation of gene expression is mediated by interactions between chromatin and protein complexes. The importance of where and when these interactions take place in the nucleus is currently a subject of intense investigation. Increasing evidence indicates that gene activation or silencing is often associated with repositioning of the locus relative to nuclear compartments and other genomic loci. At the same time, however, structural constraints impose limits on chromatin mobility. Understanding how the dynamic nature of the positioning of genetic material in the nuclear space and the higher-order architecture of the nucleus are integrated is therefore essential to our overall understanding of gene regulation.},

title = {Microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 regulates the balbiani body and animal-vegetal polarity of the zebrafish oocyte},
abstract = {Although of fundamental importance in developmental biology, the genetic basis for the symmetry breaking events that polarize the vertebrate oocyte and egg are largely unknown. In vertebrates, the first morphological asymmetry in the oocyte is the Balbiani body, a highly conserved, transient structure found in vertebrates and invertebrates including Drosophila, Xenopus, human, and mouse. We report the identification of the zebrafish magellan (mgn) mutant, which exhibits a novel enlarged Balbiani body phenotype and a disruption of oocyte polarity. To determine the molecular identity of the mgn gene, we positionally cloned the gene, employing a novel DNA capture method to target region-specific genomic DNA of 600 kb for massively parallel sequencing. Using this technique, we were able to enrich for the genomic region linked to our mutation within one week and then identify the mutation in mgn using massively parallel sequencing. This is one of the first successful uses of genomic DNA enrichment combined with massively parallel sequencing to determine the molecular identity of a gene associated with a mutant phenotype. We anticipate that the combination of these technologies will have wide applicability for the efficient identification of mutant genes in all organisms. We identified the mutation in mgn as a deletion in the coding sequence of the zebrafish microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 (macf1) gene. macf1 is a member of the highly conserved spectraplakin family of cytoskeletal linker proteins, which play diverse roles in polarized cells such as neurons, muscle cells, and epithelial cells. In mgn mutants, the oocyte nucleus is mislocalized; and the Balbiani body, localized mRNAs, and organelles are absent from the periphery of the oocyte, consistent with a function for macf1 in nuclear anchoring and cortical localization. These data provide the first evidence for a role for spectraplakins in polarization of the vertebrate oocyte and egg.},

title = {Emergence of traveling waves in the zebrafish segmentation clock},
abstract = {The spatial and temporal periodicity of somite formation is controlled by the segmentation clock, in which numerous cells cyclically express hairy-related transcriptional repressors with a posterior-to-anterior phase delay, creating 'traveling waves' of her1 expression. In zebrafish, the first traveling wave buds off from the synchronous oscillation zone in the blastoderm margin. Here we show that the emergence of a traveling wave coincides with the anterior expansion of Fgf signaling and that transplanted Fgf8b-soaked beads induce ectopic traveling waves. We thus propose that as development proceeds, the activity of Fgf signaling gradually expands anteriorly, starting from the margin, so that cells initiate her1 oscillation with a posterior-to-anterior phase delay. Furthermore, we suggest that Fgf has an essential role in establishing the period gradient that is required for the her1 spatial oscillation pattern at the emergence of the traveling wave.},

title = {Asymmetric Notch activation specifies photoreceptors R3 and R4 and planar polarity in the Drosophila eye},
abstract = {Planar polarity is seen in epidermally derived structures throughout the animal kingdom. In the Drosophila eye, planar polarity is reflected in the mirror-symmetric arrangement of ommatidia (eye units) across the dorsoventral midline or equator; ommatidia on the dorsal and ventral sides of the equator exhibit opposite chirality. Photoreceptors R3 and R4 are essential in the establishment of the polarity of ommatidia. The R3 cell is thought to receive the polarizing signal, through the receptor Frizzled (Fz), before or at higher levels then the R4 cell, generating a difference between neighbouring R3 and R4 cells. Both loss-of-function and overexpression of Fz in the R3/R4 pair result in polarity defects and loss of mirror-image symmetry. Here we identify Notch and Delta (Dl) as dominant enhancers of the phenotypes produced by overexpression of fz and dishevelled (dsh), which encodes a signalling component downstream of Fz, and we show that D1-mediated activation of Notch is required for establishment of ommatidial polarity. Whereas fz signalling is required to specify R3, Notch signalling induces the R4 fate. Our data indicate that Dl is a transcriptional target of Fz/Dsh signalling in R3, and activates Notch in the neighbouring R4 precursor. This two-tiered mechanism explains how small differences in the level and/or timing of Fz activation reliably generate a binary cell-fate decision, leading to specification of R3 and R4 and ommatidial chirality.},

title = {Learning gene regulatory networks from gene expression measurements using non-parametric molecular kinetics},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Regulation of gene expression is fundamental to the operation of a cell. Revealing the structure and dynamics of a gene regulatory network (GRN) is of great interest and represents a considerably challenging computational problem. The GRN estimation problem is complicated by the fact that the number of gene expression measurements is typically extremely small when compared to the dimension of the biological system. Further, because the gene regulation process is intrinsically complex, commonly used parametric models can provide too simple a description of the underlying phenomena and, thus, can be unreliable. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for the inference of GRNs from time-series and steady-state gene expression measurements. The presented framework is based on the use of Bayesian analysis with ordinary differential equations and nonparametric Gaussian process modeling for the transcriptional level regulation. RESULTS: The performance of the proposed structure inference method is evaluated using a recently published in vivo data set. By comparing the obtained results with those of existing ODEand Bayesian-based inference methods we demonstrate that the proposed method provides more accurate network structure learning. The predictive capabilities of the method are examined by splitting the data set into a training set and a test set and by predicting the test set based on the training set. AVAILABILITY: A MATLAB implementation of the method will beavailable from http://www.cs.tut.fi/~aijo2/gp/ upon publication. CONTACT: harri.lahdesmaki@tut.fi.},

abstract = {Frizzled family proteins have been described as receptors of Wnt signaling molecules. In Drosophila, the two known Frizzled proteins are associated with distinct developmental processes. Genesis of epithelial planar polarity requires Frizzled, whereas Dfz2 affects morphogenesis by wingless-mediated signaling. Dishevelled is required in both signaling pathways. Here, we use genetic and overexpression assays to show that Dishevelled activates JNK cascades. Rescue analysis reveals different protein domain requirements in Dishevelled for the two pathways; the C-terminal DEP domain is essential to rescue planar polarity defects and induce JNK signaling. Furthermore, the planar polarity-specific dsh1 allele is mutated in the DEP domain. Our results indicate that different Wnt/Fz signals activate distinct intracellular pathways, and Dishevelled discriminates among them by distinct domain interactions.},

title = {Time-lapse imaging and cell-specific expression profiling reveal dynamic branching and molecular determinants of a multi-dendritic nociceptor in C. elegans},
abstract = {Nociceptive neurons innervate the skin with complex dendritic arbors that respond to pain-evoking stimuli such as harsh mechanical force or extreme temperatures. Here we describe the structure and development of a model nociceptor, the PVD neuron of C. elegans, and identify transcription factors that control morphogenesis of the PVD dendritic arbor. The two PVD neuron cell bodies occupy positions on either the right (PVDR) or left (PVDL) sides of the animal in posterior-lateral locations. Imaging with a GFP reporter revealed a single axon projecting from the PVD soma to the ventral cord and an elaborate, highly branched arbor of dendritic processes that envelop the animal with a web-like array directly beneath the skin. Dendritic branches emerge in a step-wise fashion during larval development and may use an existing network of peripheral nerve cords as guideposts for key branching decisions. Time-lapse imaging revealed that branching is highly dynamic with active extension and withdrawal and that PVD branch overlap is prevented by a contact-dependent self-avoidance, a mechanism that is also employed by sensory neurons in other organisms. With the goal of identifying genes that regulate dendritic morphogenesis, we used the mRNA-tagging method to produce a gene expression profile of PVD during late larval development. This microarray experiment identified>2,000 genes that are 1.5X elevated relative to all larval cells. The enriched transcripts encode a wide range of proteins with potential roles in PVD function (e.g., DEG/ENaC and Trp channels) or development (e.g., UNC-5 and LIN-17/frizzled receptors). We used RNAi and genetic tests to screen 86 transcription factors from this list and identified eleven genes that specify PVD dendritic structure. These transcription factors appear to control discrete steps in PVD morphogenesis and may either promote or limit PVD branching at specific developmental stages. For example, time-lapse imaging revealed that MEC-3 (LIM homeodomain) is required for branch initiation in early larval development whereas EGL-44 (TEAD domain) prevents ectopic PVD branching in the adult. A comparison of PVD-enriched transcripts to a microarray profile of mammalian nociceptors revealed homologous genes with potentially shared nociceptive functions. We conclude that PVD neurons display striking structural, functional and molecular similarities to nociceptive neurons from more complex organisms and can thus provide a useful model system in which to identify evolutionarily conserved determinants of nociceptor fate.},

abstract = {Polarized cell movements shape the major features of the vertebrate body plan during development. The head-to-tail body axis of vertebrates is elongated in embryonic stages by "convergent extension" tissue movements. During these movements cells intercalate between one another transverse to the elongating body axis to form a narrower, longer array. Recent discoveries show that these polarized cell movements are controlled by homologs of genes that control the polarity of epithelial cells in the developing wing and eye of the fruit fly, Drosophila.},

title = {Actin behavior in bulk cytoplasm is cell cycle regulated in early vertebrate embryos},
abstract = {The mechanical properties of cells change as they proceed through the cell cycle, primarily owing to regulation of actin and myosin II. Most models for cell mechanics focus on actomyosin in the cortex and ignore possible roles in bulk cytoplasm. We explored cell cycle regulation of bulk cytoplasmic actomyosin in Xenopus egg extracts, which is almost undiluted cytoplasm from unfertilized eggs. We observed dramatic gelation-contraction of actomyosin in mitotic (M phase) extract where Cdk1 activity is high, but not in interphase (I-phase) extract. In spread droplets, M-phase extract exhibited regular, periodic pulses of gelation-contraction a few minutes apart that continued for many minutes. Comparing actin nucleation, disassembly and myosin II activity between M-phase and I-phase extracts, we conclude that regulation of nucleation is likely to be the most important for cell cycle regulation. We then imaged F-actin in early zebrafish blastomeres using a GFP-Utrophin probe. Polymerization in bulk cytoplasm around vesicles increased dramatically during mitosis, consistent with enhanced nucleation. We conclude that F-actin polymerization in bulk cytoplasm is cell cycle regulated in early vertebrate embryos and discuss possible biological functions of this regulation.},

Automated microscopy coupled with custom-built embryo detection and segmentation software allowed the spatial registration of reporter activity for 202 enhancer-promoter combinations, based on images of thousands of embryos. The diversity of promoter-enhancer interaction specificities underscores the importance of the core promoter sequence in cis-regulatory interactions and provides a promoter resource for transgenic reporter studies. The technology described here is also suitable for the spatial analysis of fluorescence readouts in genetic, pharmaceutical or toxicological screens.},

title = {Patterned gene expression directs bipolar planar polarity in Drosophila},
abstract = {During convergent extension in Drosophila, polarized cell movements cause the germband to narrow along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis and more than double in length along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis. This tissue remodeling requires the correct patterning of gene expression along the A-P axis, perpendicular to the direction of cell movement. Here, we demonstrate that A-P patterning information results in the polarized localization of cortical proteins in intercalating cells. In particular, cell fate differences conferred by striped expression of the even-skipped and runt pair-rule genes are both necessary and sufficient to orient planar polarity. This polarity consists of an enrichment of nonmuscle myosin II at A-P cell borders and Bazooka/PAR-3 protein at the reciprocal D-V cell borders. Moreover, bazooka mutants are defective for germband extension. These results indicate that spatial patterns of gene expression coordinate planar polarity across a multicellular population through the localized distribution of proteins required for cell movement.},

title = {Mechanisms of convergence and extension by cell intercalation},
abstract = {The cells of many embryonic tissues actively narrow in one dimension (convergence) and lengthen in the perpendicular dimension (extension). Convergence and extension are ubiquitous and important tissue movements in metazoan morphogenesis. In vertebrates, the dorsal axial and paraxial mesodermal tissues, the notochordal and somitic mesoderm, converge and extend. In amphibians as well as a number of other organisms where these movements appear, they occur by mediolateral cell intercalation, the rearrangement of cells along the mediolateral axis to produce an array that is narrower in this axis and longer in the anteroposterior axis. In amphibians, mesodermal cell intercalation is driven by bipolar, mediolaterally directed protrusive activity, which appears to exert traction on adjacent cells and pulls the cells between one another. In addition, the notochordal-somitic boundary functions in convergence and extension by 'capturing' notochordal cells as they contact the boundary, thus elongating the boundary. The prospective neural tissue also actively converges and extends parallel with the mesoderm. In contrast to the mesoderm, cell intercalation in the neural plate normally occurs by monopolar protrusive activity directed medially, towards the midline notoplate-floor-plate region. In contrast, the notoplate-floor-plate region appears to converge and extend by adhering to and being towed by or perhaps migrating on the underlying notochord. Converging and extending mesoderm stiffens by a factor of three or four and exerts up to 0.6 microN force. Therefore, active, force-producing convergent extension, the mechanism of cell intercalation, requires a mechanism to actively pull cells between one another while maintaining a tissue stiffness sufficient to push with a substantial force. Based on the evidence thus far, a cell-cell traction model of intercalation is described. The essential elements of such a morphogenic machine appear to be (i) bipolar, mediolaterally orientated or monopolar, medially directed protrusive activity; (ii) this protrusive activity results in mediolaterally orientated or medially directed traction of cells on one another; (iii) tractive protrusions are confined to the ends of the cells; (iv) a mechanically stable cell cortex over the bulk of the cell body which serves as a movable substratum for the orientated or directed cell traction. The implications of this model for cell adhesion, regulation of cell motility and cell polarity, and cell and tissue biomechanics are discussed.},

abstract = {Laser scanning microscopy provides high-resolution nondestructive in vivo imaging to capture specific structures that have been fluorescently labeled, such as cellular nuclei and membranes, throughout early zebrafish embryogenesis. An increasingly challenging problem biologists must face is how to effectively explore, follow, and study the thousands of cells contained in the resulting time-varying volume data that are large in space, time, and variable domain. Visual data explorations, such as direct volume rendering, have been successfully used for the analysis of volumetric data. However, visualizing large-scale time-varying fields remains a challenging problem. In this paper we present a novel Focus+Context animated volume rendering. The technique is based on the distance map of objects of interest and on a scene graph architecture. We demonstrate that distance map driven volume rendering, implemented in modern graphics hardware, is suited to generate run time and interactive representations such as ghosted rendering and cut-away rendering. The experimental results on zebrafish embryogenesis data demonstrate that the technique is suited to uncover and to analyze biological events, such as organogenesis, contained in time-varying volumetric dataset.},

This period is characterized by the formation of the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes, the development of the three germ layers, the specification of organ progenitors, and the complex morphogenetic movements of cells. During the past 10 years a combination of genetic, embryological, and molecular analyses has provided detailed insights into the mechanisms underlying this process. Maternal determinants control the expression of transcription factors and the location of signaling centers that pattern the blastula and gastrula. Bmp, Nodal, FGF, canonical Wnt, and retinoic acid signals generate positional information that leads to the restricted expression of transcription factors that control cell type specification. Noncanonical Wnt signaling is required for the morphogenetic movements during gastrulation. We review how the coordinated interplay of these molecules determines the fate and movement of embryonic cells.},

abstract = {Mesoderm formation is critical for the establishment of the animal body plan and in Drosophila requires the snail gene. This report concerns the cloning and expression pattern of the structurally similar gene snail1 from zebrafish. In situ hybridization shows that the quantity of snail1 RNA increases at the margin of the blastoderm in cells that involute during gastrulation. As gastrulation begins, snail1 RNA disappears from the dorsal axial mesoderm and becomes restricted to the paraxial mesoderm and the tail bud. snail1 RNA increases in cells that define the posterior border of each somite and then disappears when somitic cells differentiate. Later in development, expression appears in cephalic neural crest derivatives. Many snail1-expressing cells were missing from mutant spadetail embryos and the quantity of snail1 RNA was greatly reduced in mutant no tail embryos. The work presented here suggests that snail1 is involved in morphogenetic events during gastrulation, somitogenesis and development of the cephalic neural crest, and that no tail may act as a positive regulator of snail1.},

abstract = {The neo-Darwinian paradigm benefits from the assumption that phenotypic variation is gradual and that phenotype and genotype have a relatively simple relationship. These assumptions are historically inherited from the times of the neo-Darwinian synthesis and, consequently, do not include present understanding about development. In this study, understanding about the dynamics of pattern formation is used to explore to that extent phenotypic variation can be expected to be gradual and simply related to molecular variation. Variation in simple phenotypes seems to fit neo-Darwinian assumptions but variation in complex phenotypes does not. Instead, variation in complex phenotypes would have a tendency to relatively less gradual evolution, even at microevolutionary time scales, that would make phylogenetic reconstructions more difficult. In addition, they will have a tendency to exhibit specific trends in innovation rates over group radiations with early accelerations and late decelerations. This work also explores further consequences of these results in our understanding of phenotypic evolution.},

title = {Signaling networks guiding epithelial-mesenchymal transitions during embryogenesis and cancer progression},
abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes the differentiation switch between polarized epithelial cells and contractile and motile mesenchymal cells, and facilitates cell movements and generation of new tissue types during embryogenesis. Many secreted polypeptides are implicated in the EMT process and their corresponding intracellular transduction pathways form highly interconnected networks. Transforming growth factor-beta, Wnt, Notch and growth factors acting through tyrosine kinase receptors induce EMT and often act in a sequential manner. Such growth factors orchestrate the concerted regulation of an elaborate gene program and a complex protein network, needed for establishment of new mesenchymal phenotypes after disassembly of the main elements of epithelial architecture, such as desmosomes, as well as tight, adherens and gap junctions. EMT of tumor cells occurs during cancer progression and possibly generates cell types of the tumor stroma, such as cancer-associated myofibroblasts. EMT contributes to new tumor cell properties required for invasiveness and vascular intravasation during metastasis. Here we present some of the current mechanisms that mediate the process of EMT and discuss their relevance to cancer progression.},

title = {The Bmp gradient of the zebrafish gastrula guides migrating lateral cells by regulating cell-cell adhesion},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps) are required for the specification of ventrolateral cell fates during embryonic dorsoventral patterning and for proper convergence and extension gastrulation movements, but the mechanisms underlying the latter role remained elusive. RESULTS: Via bead implantations, we show that the Bmp gradient determines the direction of lateral mesodermal cell migration during dorsal convergence in the zebrafish gastrula. This effect is independent of its role during dorsoventral patterning and of noncanonical Wnt signaling. However, it requires Bmp signal transduction through Alk8 and Smad5 to negatively regulate Ca(2+)/Cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesiveness. In vivo, converging mesodermal cells form lamellipodia that attach to adjacent cells. Bmp signaling diminishes the Cadherin-dependent stability of such contact points, thereby abrogating subsequent cell displacement during lamellipodial retraction. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the ventral-to-dorsal Bmp gradient has an instructive role to establish a reverse gradient of cell-cell adhesiveness, thereby defining different migratory zones and directing lamellipodia-driven cell migrations during dorsal convergence in lateral regions of the zebrafish gastrula.},

abstract = {How cell collectives move and deposit subunits within a developing embryo is a question of outstanding interest. In many cases, a chemotactic mechanism is employed, where cells move up or down a previously generated attractive or repulsive gradient of signalling molecules. Recent studies revealed the existence of systems with isotropic chemoattractant expression in the lateral line primordium of zebrafish. Here we propose a mechanism for a cell collective, which actively modulates an isotropically expressed ligand and encodes an initial symmetry breaking in its velocity. We derive a closed solution for the velocity and identify an optimal length that maximizes the tissues' velocity. A length dependent polar gradient is identified, its use for pro-neuromast deposition is shown by simulations and a critical time for cell deposition is derived. Experiments to verify this model are suggested.},

title = {Cellular patterning of the vertebrate embryo},
abstract = {Recent studies show that cell dispersal is a widespread phenomenon in the development of early vertebrate embryos. These cell movements coincide with major decisions for the spatial organization of the embryo, and they parallel genetic patterning events. For example, in the central nervous system, cell dispersal is first mainly anterior-posterior and subsequently dorsal-ventral. Thus, genes expressed in signaling centers of the embryo probably control cell movements, tightly linking cellular and genetic patterning. Cell dispersal might be important for the correct positioning of cells and tissues involved in intercellular signaling. The emergence of cell dispersal at the onset of vertebrate evolution indicates a shift from early, lineage-based cellular patterning in small embryos to late, movement-based cellular patterning of polyclones in large embryos. The conservation of the same basic body plan by invertebrate and vertebrate chordates suggests that evolution of the embryonic period preceding the phylotypic stage was by intercalary co-option of basic cell activities present in the ancestral metazoan cell.},

abstract = {Normal tissue cells are generally not viable when suspended in a fluid and are therefore said to be anchorage dependent. Such cells must adhere to a solid, but a solid can be as rigid as glass or softer than a baby's skin. The behavior of some cells on soft materials is characteristic of important phenotypes; for example, cell growth on soft agar gels is used to identify cancer cells. However, an understanding of how tissue cells-including fibroblasts, myocytes, neurons, and other cell types-sense matrix stiffness is just emerging with quantitative studies of cells adhering to gels (or to other cells) with which elasticity can be tuned to approximate that of tissues. Key roles in molecular pathways are played by adhesion complexes and the actinmyosin cytoskeleton, whose contractile forces are transmitted through transcellular structures. The feedback of local matrix stiffness on cell state likely has important implications for development, differentiation, disease, and regeneration.},

They are composed of two ring-like F-actin structures that form at the deep cell and enveloping layer margins of the blastoderm and a punctate actin band that develops in the external yolk syncytial layer. Treatment with cytochalasin B or the calcium chelator dibromo-BAPTA results in the disruption of all three of these actin-based structures, leading to the slowing or immediate arrest of epiboly, respectively, followed by a failure of yolk cell occlusion and the eventual lysis of the embryo through the vegetal pole region. We suggest, therefore, that these structures function in the occlusion of the vegetal portion of the yolk cell during the latter stages of epiboly. Possible roles for these new structures, their modulation by Ca2+, as well as the functions of other previously described F-actin--based structures observed throughout epiboly, are discussed.},

abstract = {The "segmentation clock" is thought to coordinate sequential segmentation of the body axis in vertebrate embryos. This clock comprises a multicellular genetic network of synchronized oscillators, coupled by intercellular Delta-Notch signaling. How this synchrony is established and how its loss determines the position of segmentation defects in Delta and Notch mutants are unknown. We analyzed the clock's synchrony dynamics by varying strength and timing of Notch coupling in zebra-fish embryos with techniques for quantitative perturbation of gene function. We developed a physical theory based on coupled phase oscillators explaining the observed onset and rescue of segmentation defects, the clock's robustness against developmental noise, and a critical point beyond which synchrony decays. We conclude that synchrony among these genetic oscillators can be established by simultaneous initiation and self-organization and that the segmentation defect position is determined by the difference between coupling strength and noise.},

title = {Physics and the canalization of morphogenesis: a grand challenge in organismal biology},
abstract = {Morphogenesis takes place against a background of organism-to-organism and environmental variation. Therefore, fundamental questions in the study of morphogenesis include: How are the mechanical processes of tissue movement and deformation affected by that variability, and in turn, how do the mechanic of the system modulate phenotypic variation? We highlight a few key factors, including environmental temperature, embryo size and environmental chemistry that might perturb the mechanics of morphogenesis in natural populations. Then we discuss several ways in which mechanics-including feedback from mechanical cues-might influence intra-specific variation in morphogenesis. To understand morphogenesis it will be necessary to consider whole-organism, environment and evolutionary scales because these larger scales present the challenges that developmental mechanisms have evolved to cope with. Studying the variation organisms express and the variation organisms experience will aid in deciphering the causes of birth defects.},

title = {Convergence and extension movements during vertebrate gastrulation},
abstract = {During vertebrate gastrulation, coordinated cell movements shape the basic body plan. Key components of gastrulation are convergence and extension (C{\&}E) movements, which narrow and lengthen the embryonic tissues, respectively. The rates of C{\&}E movements differ significantly according to the position and the stage of gastrulation. Here, we review the distinct cellular behaviors that define the spatial and temporal patterns of C{\&}E movements, with the special emphasis on zebrafish. We also summarize the molecular regulation of these cellular behaviors and the interplay between different signaling pathways that drive C{\&}E. Finally, to ensure efficient C{\&}E movements, cells must achieve mediolaterally-elongated cell morphology and polarize motile protrusions. We discuss the recent discoveries on the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the mediolateral cell polarity is established.},

title = {Oscillatory behaviors and hierarchical assembly of contractile structures in intercalating cells},
abstract = {Fluctuations in the size of the apical cell surface have been associated with apical constriction and tissue invagination. However, it is currently not known if apical oscillatory behaviors are a unique property of constricting cells or if they constitute a universal feature of the force balance between cells in multicellular tissues. Here, we set out to determine whether oscillatory cell behaviors occur in parallel with cell intercalation during the morphogenetic process of axis elongation in the Drosophila embryo. We applied multi-color, time-lapse imaging of living embryos and SIESTA, an integrated tool for automated and semi-automated cell segmentation, tracking, and analysis of image sequences. Using SIESTA, we identified cycles of contraction and expansion of the apical surface in intercalating cells and characterized them at the molecular, cellular, and tissue scales. We demonstrate that apical oscillations are anisotropic, and this anisotropy depends on the presence of intact cell-cell junctions and spatial cues provided by the anterior-posterior patterning system. Oscillatory cell behaviors during axis elongation are associated with the hierarchical assembly and disassembly of contractile actomyosin structures at the medial cortex of the cell, with actin localization preceding myosin II and with the localization of both proteins preceding changes in cell shape. We discuss models to explain how the architecture of cytoskeletal networks regulates their contractile behavior and the mechanisms that give rise to oscillatory cell behaviors in intercalating cells.},

title = {Control of convergent yolk syncytial layer nuclear movement in zebrafish},
abstract = {Nuclear movements play an essential role in metazoan development. Although the intracellular transport mechanisms underlying nuclear movements have been studied in detail, relatively little is known about signals from surrounding cells and tissues controlling these movements. Here, we show that, in gastrulating zebrafish embryos, convergence movements of nuclei within the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) are guided by mesoderm and endoderm progenitors migrating along the surface of the yolk towards the dorsal side of the developing gastrula. Progenitor cells direct the convergence movements of internal yolk syncytial nuclei (iYSN) by modulating cortical flow within the YSL in which the iYSN are entrained. The effect of mesoderm and endoderm progenitors on the convergence movement of iYSN depends on the expression of E-cadherin, indicating that adhesive contact between the cells and the YSL is required for the mesendoderm-modulated YSL cortical flow mediating nuclear convergence. In summary, our data reveal a crucial function for cortical flow in the coordination of syncytial nuclear movements with surrounding cells and tissues during zebrafish gastrulation.},

title = {Second harmonic generating (SHG) nanoprobes for in vivo imaging},
abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy has profoundly changed cell and molecular biology studies by permitting tagged gene products to be followed as they function and interact. The ability of a fluorescent dye to absorb and emit light of different wavelengths allows it to generate startling contrast that, in the best cases, can permit single molecule detection and tracking. However, in many experimental settings, fluorescent probes fall short of their potential due to dye bleaching, dye signal saturation, and tissue autofluorescence. Here, we demonstrate that second harmonic generating (SHG) nanoprobes can be used for in vivo imaging, circumventing many of the limitations of classical fluorescence probes. Under intense illumination, such as at the focus of a laser-scanning microscope, these SHG nanocrystals convert two photons into one photon of half the wavelength; thus, when imaged by conventional two-photon microscopy, SHG nanoprobes appear to generate a signal with an inverse Stokes shift like a fluorescent dye, but with a narrower emission. Unlike commonly used fluorescent probes, SHG nanoprobes neither bleach nor blink, and the signal they generate does not saturate with increasing illumination intensity. The resulting contrast and detectability of SHG nanoprobes provide unique advantages for molecular imaging of living cells and tissues.},

abstract = {Fibronectin (FN) forms the primitive fibrillar matrix in both embryos and healing wounds. To study the matrix in living cell cultures, we have constructed a cell line that secretes FN molecules chimeric with green fluorescent protein. These FN-green fluorescent protein molecules were assembled into a typical matrix that was easily visualized by fluorescence over periods of several hours. FN fibrils remained mostly straight, and they were seen to extend and contract to accommodate movements of the cells, indicating that they are elastic. When fibrils were broken or detached from cells, they contracted to less than one-fourth of their extended length, demonstrating that they are highly stretched in the living culture. Previous work from other laboratories has suggested that cryptic sites for FN assembly may be exposed by tension on FN. Our results show directly that FN matrix fibrils are not only under tension but are also highly stretched. This stretched state of FN is an obvious candidate for exposing the cryptic assembly sites.},

title = {Somitogenesis clock-wave initiation requires differential decay and multiple binding sites for clock protein},
abstract = {Somitogenesis is a process common to all vertebrate embryos in which repeated blocks of cells arise from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) to lay a foundational pattern for trunk and tail development. Somites form in the wake of passing waves of periodic gene expression that originate in the tailbud and sweep posteriorly across the PSM. Previous work has suggested that the waves result from a spatiotemporally graded control protein that affects the oscillation rate of clock-gene expression. With a minimally constructed mathematical model, we study the contribution of two control mechanisms to the initial formation of this gene-expression wave. We test four biologically motivated model scenarios with either one or two clock protein transcription binding sites, and with or without differential decay rates for clock protein monomers and dimers. We examine the sensitivity of wave formation with respect to multiple model parameters and robustness to heterogeneity in cell population. We find that only a model with both multiple binding sites and differential decay rates is able to reproduce experimentally observed waveforms. Our results show that the experimentally observed characteristics of somitogenesis wave initiation constrain the underlying genetic control mechanisms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Relating features of protein sequences to structural hinges is important for identifying domain boundaries, understanding structure-function relationships, and designing flexibility into proteins. Efforts in this field have been hampered by the lack of a proper dataset for studying characteristics of hinges. RESULTS: Using the Molecular Motions Database we have created a Hinge Atlas of manually annotated hinges and a statistical formalism for calculating the enrichment of various types of residues in these hinges. CONCLUSION: We found various correlations between hinges and sequence features. Some of these are expected; for instance, we found that hinges tend to occur on the surface and in coils and turns and to be enriched with small and hydrophilic residues. Others are less obvious and intuitive. In particular, we found that hinges tend to coincide with active sites, but unlike the latter they are not at all conserved in evolution. We evaluate the potential for hinge prediction based on sequence. Motions play an important role in catalysis and protein-ligand interactions. Hinge bending motions comprise the largest class of known motions. Therefore it is important to relate the hinge location to sequence features such as residue type, physicochemical class, secondary structure, solvent exposure, evolutionary conservation, and proximity to active sites. To do this, we first generated the Hinge Atlas, a set of protein motions with the hinge locations manually annotated, and then studied the coincidence of these features with the hinge location. We found that all of the features have bearing on the hinge location. Most interestingly, we found that hinges tend to occur at or near active sites and yet unlike the latter are not conserved. Less surprisingly, we found that hinge residues tend to be small, not hydrophobic or aliphatic, and occur in turns and random coils on the surface. A functional sequence based hinge predictor was made which uses some of the data generated in this study. The Hinge Atlas is made available to the community for further flexibility studies.},

title = {Coordination of plant cell division and expansion in a simple morphogenetic system},
abstract = {Morphogenesis in plants arises from the interplay of genetic and physical interactions within a growing network of cells. The physical aspects of cell proliferation and differentiation are genetically regulated, but constrained by mechanical interactions between the cells. Higher plant tissues consist of an elaborate three-dimensional matrix of active cytoplasm and extracellular matrix, where it is difficult to obtain direct measurements of geometry or cell interactions. To properly understand the workings of plant morphogenesis, it is necessary to have biological systems that allow simple and direct observation of these processes. We have adopted a highly simplified plant system to investigate how cell proliferation and expansion is coordinated during morphogenesis. Coleocheate scutata is a microscopic fresh-water green alga with simple anatomical features that allow for accurate quantification of morphogenetic processes. Image analysis techniques were used to extract precise models for cell geometry and physical parameters for growth. This allowed construction of a deformable finite element model for growth of the whole organism, which incorporated cell biophysical properties, viscous expansion of cell walls, and rules for regulation of cell behavior. The study showed that a simple set of autonomous, cell-based rules are sufficient to account for the morphological and dynamic properties of Coleochaete growth. A variety of morphogenetic behavior emerged from the application of these local rules. Cell shape sensing is sufficient to explain the patterns of cell division during growth. This simplifying principle is likely to have application in modeling and design for engineering of higher plant tissues.},

abstract = {Biological systems involving short-range activators and long-range inhibitors can generate complex patterns. Reaction-diffusion models postulate that differences in signaling range are caused by differential diffusivity of inhibitor and activator. Other models suggest that differential clearance underlies different signaling ranges. To test these models, we measured the biophysical properties of the Nodal/Lefty activator/inhibitor system during zebrafish embryogenesis. Analysis of Nodal and Lefty gradients revealed that Nodals have a shorter range than Lefty proteins. Pulse-labeling analysis indicated that Nodals and Leftys have similar clearance kinetics, whereas fluorescence recovery assays revealed that Leftys have a higher effective diffusion coefficient than Nodals. These results indicate that differential diffusivity is the major determinant of the differences in Nodal/Lefty range and provide biophysical support for reaction-diffusion models of activator/inhibitor-mediated patterning.},

Here, we review work based on the convergence of physics, engineering and biology that suggests that mechanical forces generated by living cells are as crucial as genes and chemical signals for the control of embryological development, morphogenesis and tissue patterning.},

title = {Coaction of intercellular adhesion and cortical tension specifies tissue surface tension},
abstract = {In the course of animal morphogenesis, large-scale cell movements occur, which involve the rearrangement, mutual spreading, and compartmentalization of cell populations in specific configurations. Morphogenetic cell rearrangements such as cell sorting and mutual tissue spreading have been compared with the behaviors of immiscible liquids, which they closely resemble. Based on this similarity, it has been proposed that tissues behave as liquids and possess a characteristic surface tension, which arises as a collective, macroscopic property of groups of mobile, cohering cells. But how are tissue surface tensions generated? Different theories have been proposed to explain how mesoscopic cell properties such as cell-cell adhesion and contractility of cell interfaces may underlie tissue surface tensions. Although recent work suggests that both may be contributors, an explicit model for the dependence of tissue surface tension on these mesoscopic parameters has been missing. Here we show explicitly that the ratio of adhesion to cortical tension determines tissue surface tension. Our minimal model successfully explains the available experimental data and makes predictions, based on the feedback between mechanical energy and geometry, about the shapes of aggregate surface cells, which we verify experimentally. This model indicates that there is a crossover from adhesion dominated to cortical-tension dominated behavior as a function of the ratio between these two quantities.},

title = {Do morphogen gradients arise by diffusion?},
abstract = {Many patterns of cell and tissue organization are specified during development by gradients of morphogens, substances that assign different cell fates at different concentrations. Gradients form by morphogen transport from a localized site, but whether this occurs by simple diffusion or by more elaborate mechanisms is unclear. We attempt to resolve this controversy by analyzing recent data in ways that appropriately capture the complexity of systems in which transport, receptor interaction, endo- and exocytosis, and degradation occur together. We find that diffusive mechanisms of morphogen transport are much more plausible-and nondiffusive mechanisms much less plausible-than has generally been argued. Moreover, we show that a class of experiments, endocytic blockade, thought to effectively distinguish between diffusive and nondiffusive transport models actually fails to draw useful distinctions.},

title = {The mechanical basis of cell rearrangement. I. Epithelial morphogenesis during Fundulus epiboly},
abstract = {Many morphogenetic processes are accomplished by coordinated cell rearrangements. These rearrangements are accompanied by substantial shifts in the neighbor relationships between cells. Here we propose a model for studying morphogenesis in epithelial sheets by directed cell neighbor change. Our model describes cell rearrangements by accounting for the balance of forces between neighboring cells within an epithelium. Cell rearrangement and cell shape changes occur when these forces are not in mechanical equilibrium. We will show that cell rearrangement within the epidermal enveloping layer (EVL) of the teleost fish Fundulus during epiboly can be explained solely in terms of the balance of forces generated among constituent epithelial cells. Within a cell, we account for circumferential elastic forces and the force generated by hydrostatic and osmotic pressure. The model treats epithelial cells as two-dimensional polygons where the mechanical forces are applied to the polygonal nodes. A cell node protrudes or contracts when the nodal forces are not in mechanical equilibrium. In an epithelial sheet, adjacent cells share common boundary nodes; in this way, mechanical force is transmitted from cell to cell, mimicking junctional coupling. These junctional nodes can slide, and nodes may appear or disappear, so that the number of polygonal sides is variable. Computer graphics allows us to compare numerical simulations of the model with time-lapse cinemicroscopy of cell rearrangements in the living embryo, and data obtained from fixed and silver stained embryos. By manipulating the mechanical properties of the model cells we can study the conditions necessary to reproduce normal cell behavior during Fundulus epiboly. We find that simple stress relaxation is sufficient to account for cell rearrangements among interior cells of the EVL when they are isotropically contractile. Experimental observations show that the number of EVL marginal cells continuously decreases throughout epiboly. In order for the simulation to reproduce this behavior, cells at the EVL boundary must generate protrusive forces rather than contractile tension forces. Therefore, the simulation results suggest that the mechanical properties of EVL marginal cells at their leading edge must be quite different from EVL interior cells.},

abstract = {Although genetic control of morphogenesis is well established, elaboration of complex shapes requires changes in the mechanical properties of cells. In plants, the first visible sign of leaf formation is a bulge on the flank of the shoot apical meristem. Bulging results from local relaxation of cell walls, which causes them to yield to internal hydrostatic pressure. By manipulation of tissue tension in combination with quantitative live imaging and finite-element modeling, we found that the slow-growing area at the shoot tip is substantially strain-stiffened compared with surrounding fast-growing tissue. We propose that strain siffening limist growth, restricts organ bulging, and contributes to the meristem's functional zonation. Thus, mechanical signals are not just passive readoust of gene action but feed back on morphogenesis.},

Here, we investigate this problem in the developing wing of Drosophila. The surface of the wing is decorated by hexagonally packed hairs that are uniformly oriented by the planar cell polarity pathway. They are constructed by a hexagonal array of wing epithelial cells. Wing epithelial cells are irregularly arranged throughout most of development, but they become hexagonally packed shortly before hair formation. During the process, individual cell boundaries grow and shrink, resulting in local neighbor exchanges, and Cadherin is actively endocytosed and recycled through Rab11 endosomes. Hexagonal packing depends on the activity of the planar cell polarity proteins. We propose that these proteins polarize trafficking of Cadherin-containing exocyst vesicles during junction remodeling. This may be a common mechanism for the action of planar cell polarity proteins in diverse systems.},

Here we use this synthetic method to challenge specific predictions of the sea urchin embryo endomesoderm GRN. Expression vectors generated by in vitro recombination of exogenous sequences into BACs were used to cause elements of a nonskeletogenic mesoderm GRN to be deployed in skeletogenic cells and to detect their effects. The result of reengineering the regulatory circuitry in this way was to divert the developmental program of these cells from skeletogenesis to pigment cell formation, confirming a direct prediction of the GRN. In addition, the experiment revealed previously undetected cryptic repression functions.},

title = {Gene expression divergence recapitulates the developmental hourglass model},
abstract = {The observation that animal morphology tends to be conserved during the embryonic phylotypic period (a period of maximal similarity between the species within each animal phylum) led to the proposition that embryogenesis diverges more extensively early and late than in the middle, known as the hourglass model. This pattern of conservation is thought to reflect a major constraint on the evolution of animal body plans. Despite a wealth of morphological data confirming that there is often remarkable divergence in the early and late embryos of species from the same phylum, it is not yet known to what extent gene expression evolution, which has a central role in the elaboration of different animal forms, underpins the morphological hourglass pattern. Here we address this question using species-specific microarrays designed from six sequenced Drosophila species separated by up to 40 million years. We quantify divergence at different times during embryogenesis, and show that expression is maximally conserved during the arthropod phylotypic period. By fitting different evolutionary models to each gene, we show that at each time point more than 80% of genes fit best to models incorporating stabilizing selection, and that for genes whose evolutionarily optimal expression level is the same across all species, selective constraint is maximized during the phylotypic period. The genes that conform most to the hourglass pattern are involved in key developmental processes. These results indicate that natural selection acts to conserve patterns of gene expression during mid-embryogenesis, and provide a genome-wide insight into the molecular basis of the hourglass pattern of developmental evolution.},

title = {Cellular automata as microscopic models of cell migration in heterogeneous environments},
abstract = {Understanding the precise interplay of moving cells with their typically heterogeneous environment is crucial for central biological processes as embryonic morphogenesis, wound healing, immune reactions or tumor growth. Mathematical models allow for the analysis of cell migration strategies involving complex feedback mechanisms between the cells and their microenvironment. Here, we introduce a cellular automaton (especially lattice-gas cellular automaton-LGCA) as a microscopic model of cell migration together with a (mathematical) tensor characterization of different biological environments. Furthermore, we show how mathematical analysis of the LGCA model can yield an estimate for the cell dispersion speed within a given environment. Novel imaging techniques like diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may provide tensor data of biological microenvironments. As an application, we present LGCA simulations of a proliferating cell population moving in an external field defined by clinical DTI data. This system can serve as a model of in vivo glioma cell invasion.},

title = {Notch signaling controls cell fate specification along the dorsoventral axis of the Drosophila gut},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gut formation is a key event during animal development. Recent genetic analysis in chick, mice, and Drosophila has identified Hedgehog and TGFbeta signals as essential players for the development of the primitive gut tube along its anterior-posterior (AP) axis. However, the genetic programs that control gut patterning along its dorsoventral (DV) axis have remained largely elusive. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the activation of the Notch receptor occurs in a single row of boundary cells which separates dorsal from ventral cells in the Drosophila hindgut. rhomboid, which encodes a transmembrane protein, and knirps/knirps-related, which encode nuclear steroid receptors, are Notch target genes required for the expression of crumbs, which encodes a transmembrane protein involved in organizing apical-basal polarity. Notch receptor activation depends on the expression of its ligand Delta in ventral cells, and localizing the Notch receptor to the apical domain of the boundary cells may be required for proper signaling. The analysis of gene expression mediated by a Notch response element suggests that boundary cell-specific expression can be obtained by cooperation of Suppressor of Hairless and the transcription factor Grainyhead or a related factor. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that Notch signaling plays a pivotal role in determining cell fates along the DV axis of the Drosophila hindgut. The finding that Notch signaling results in the expression of an apical polarity organizer which may be required, in turn, for apical Notch receptor localization suggests a simple mechanism by which the specification of a single cell row might be controlled.},

Using a whole-genome association strategy, we identified polymorphisms that explain nearly 15% of the variation among individuals in viral load during the asymptomatic set-point period of infection. One of these is found within an endogenous retroviral element and is associated with major histocompatibility allele human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*5701, whereas a second is located near the HLA-C gene. An additional analysis of the time to HIV disease progression implicated two genes, one of which encodes an RNA polymerase I subunit. These findings emphasize the importance of studying human genetic variation as a guide to combating infectious agents.},

title = {Developmental gene regulatory networks in the zebrafish embryo},
abstract = {The genomic developmental program operates mainly through the regulated expression of genes encoding transcription factors and signaling pathways. Complex networks of regulatory genetic interactions control developmental cell specification and fates. Development in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, has been studied extensively and large amounts of experimental data, including information on spatial and temporal gene expression patterns, are available. A wide variety of maternal and zygotic regulatory factors and signaling pathways have been discovered in zebrafish, and these provide a useful starting point for reconstructing the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) underlying development. In this review, we describe in detail the genetic regulatory subcircuits responsible for dorsoanterior-ventroposterior patterning and endoderm formation. We describe a number of regulatory motifs, which appear to act as the functional building blocks of the GRNs. Different positive feedback loops drive the ventral and dorsal specification processes. Mutual exclusivity in dorsal-ventral polarity in zebrafish is governed by intra-cellular cross-inhibiting GRN motifs, including vent/dharma and tll1/chordin. The dorsal-ventral axis seems to be determined by competition between two maternally driven positive-feedback loops (one operating on Dharma, the other on Bmp). This is the first systematic approach aimed at developing an integrated model of the GRNs underlying zebrafish development. Comparison of GRNs' organizational motifs between different species will provide insights into developmental specification and its evolution. The online version of the zebrafish GRNs can be found at http://www.zebrafishGRNs.org.},

abstract = {In amphibian and teleost embryos, the dorsal determinants (DDs) are believed to be initially localized to the vegetal pole and then transported to the prospective dorsal side of the embryo along a microtubule array. The DDs are known to activate the canonical Wnt pathway and thereby promote the expression of genes that induce the dorsal organizer. Here, by identifying the locus of the maternal-effect ventralized mutant tokkaebi, we show that Syntabulin, a linker of the kinesin I motor protein, is essential for dorsal determination in zebrafish. We found that syntabulin mRNA is transported to the vegetal pole during oogenesis through the Bucky ball (Buc)-mediated Balbiani body-dependent pathway, which is necessary for establishment of animal-vegetal (AV) oocyte polarity. We demonstrate that Syntabulin is translocated from the vegetal pole in a microtubule-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that Syntabulin regulates the microtubule-dependent transport of the DDs, and provide evidence for the link between AV and dorsoventral axis formation.},

title = {Origin and development of the zebrafish endoderm},
abstract = {The segregation of cells into germ layers is one of the earliest events in the establishment of cell fate in the embryo. In the zebrafish, endoderm and mesoderm are derived from cells that involute into an internal layer, the hypoblast, whereas ectoderm is derived from cells that remain in the outer layer, the epiblast. In this study, we examine the origin of the zebrafish endoderm and its separation from the mesoderm. By labeling individual cells located at the margin of the blastula, we demonstrate that all structures that are endodermal in origin are derived predominantly from the more dorsal and lateral cells of the blastoderm margin. Frequently marginal cells give rise to both endodermal and mesodermal derivatives, demonstrating that these two lineages have not yet separated. Cells located farther than 4 cell diameters from the margin give rise exclusively to mesoderm, and not to endoderm. Following involution, we see a variety of cellular changes indicating the differentiation of the two germ layers. Endodermal cells gradually flatten and extend filopodial processes forming a noncontiguous inner layer of cells against the yolk. At this time, they also begin to express Forkhead-domain 2 protein. Mesodermal cells form a coherent layer of round cells separating the endoderm and ectoderm. In cyclops-mutant embryos that have reduced mesodermal anlage, we demonstrate that by late gastrulation not only mesodermal but also endodermal cells are fewer in number. This suggests that a common pathway initially specifies germ layers together before a progressive sequence of determinative events segregate endoderm and mesoderm into morphologically distinct germ layers.},

title = {Notochord morphogenesis in Xenopus laevis: simulation of cell behavior underlying tissue convergence and extension},
abstract = {Cell intercalation and cell shape changes drive notochord morphogenesis in the African frog, Xenopus laevis. Experimental observations show that cells elongate mediolaterally and intercalate between one another, causing the notochord to lengthen and narrow. Descriptive observations provide few clues as to the mechanisms that coordinate and drive these cell movements. It is possible that a few rules governing cell behavior could orchestrate the shaping of the entire tissue. We test this hypothesis by constructing a computer model of the tissue to investigate how rules governing cell motility and cell-cell interactions can account for the major features of notochord morphogenesis. These rules are drawn from the literature on in vitro cell studies and experimental observations of notochord cell behavior. The following types of motility rules are investigated: (1) refractory tissue boundaries that inhibit cell motility, (2) statistical persistence of motion, (3) contact inhibition of protrusion between cells, and (4) polarized and nonpolarized protrusive activity. We show that only the combination of refractory boundaries, contact inhibition and polarized protrusive activity reproduces normal notochord development. Guided by these rules, cells spontaneously align into a parallel array of elongating cells. Self alignment optimizes the geometric conditions for polarized protrusive activity by progressively minimizing contact inhibition between cells. Cell polarization, initiated at refractory tissue boundaries, spreads along successive cell rows into the tissue interior as cells restrict and constrain their neighbors' directional bias. The model demonstrates that several experimentally observed intrinsic cell behaviors, operating simultaneously, may underlie the generation of coordinated cell movements within the developing notochord.},

abstract = {Basement membrane matrix is known to induce human endothelial cells to form cord-like structures that mimic those observed during early angiogenesis in vivo. Using this model, blocking antibody studies revealed a major role for the alpha 6 beta 1 integrin in cord formation. During this process, two alterations in the Matrigel structure were observed which suggested a mechanism for the precision of cord formation. First, Matrigel contracted and lifted off an agarose support and second, linear distortions became visible in the Matrigel that correspond to the migration pathways of endothelial cell processes. These pathways, which we have termed "matrix guidance pathways," appear to result from the generation of mechanical tension between endothelial cells. The above data support the concept that endothelial cell guidance during morphogenetic events could be controlled by the ability of these cells to exert mechanical forces on the surrounding extracellular matrix to create pathways for migration.},

Duct initiation required proliferation, Rac, and myosin light-chain kinase, whereas repolarization to a bilayer depended on Rho kinase. We observed that branching morphogenesis results from the active motility of both luminal and myoepithelial cells. Luminal epithelial cells advanced collectively, whereas myoepithelial cells appeared to restrain elongating ducts. Significantly, we observed that normal epithelium and neoplastic hyperplasias are organized similarly, suggesting common mechanisms of epithelial growth.},

abstract = {Quantifying cell behaviors in animal early embryogenesis remains a challenging issue requiring in toto imaging and automated image analysis. We designed a framework for imaging and reconstructing unstained whole zebrafish embryos for their first 10 cell division cycles and report measurements along the cell lineage with micrometer spatial resolution and minute temporal accuracy. Point-scanning multiphoton excitation optimized to preferentially probe the innermost regions of the embryo provided intrinsic signals highlighting all mitotic spindles and cell boundaries. Automated image analysis revealed the phenomenology of cell proliferation. Blastomeres continuously drift out of synchrony. After the 32-cell stage, the cell cycle lengthens according to cell radial position, leading to apparent division waves. Progressive amplification of this process is the rule, contrasting with classical descriptions of abrupt changes in the system dynamics.},

title = {Slb/Wnt11 controls hypoblast cell migration and morphogenesis at the onset of zebrafish gastrulation},
abstract = {During vertebrate gastrulation, highly coordinated cellular rearrangements lead to the formation of the three germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. In zebrafish, silberblick (slb)/wnt11 regulates normal gastrulation movements by activating a signalling pathway similar to the Frizzled-signalling pathway, which establishes epithelial planar cell polarity (PCP) in Drosophila. However, the cellular mechanisms by which slb/wnt11 functions during zebrafish gastrulation are still unclear. Using high-resolution two-photon confocal imaging followed by computer-assisted reconstruction and motion analysis, we have analysed the movement and morphology of individual cells in three dimensions during the course of gastrulation. We show that in slb-mutant embryos, hypoblast cells within the forming germ ring have slower, less directed migratory movements at the onset of gastrulation. These aberrant cell movements are accompanied by defects in the orientation of cellular processes along the individual movement directions of these cells. We conclude that slb/wnt11-mediated orientation of cellular processes plays a role in facilitating and stabilising movements of hypoblast cells in the germ ring, thereby pointing at a novel function of the slb/wnt11 signalling pathway for the regulation of migratory cell movements at early stages of gastrulation.},

title = {Pattern formation by a moving morphogen source},
abstract = {During Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis, the follicular epithelium that envelops the germline cyst gives rise to an elaborate eggshell, which houses the future embryo and mediates its interaction with the environment. A prominent feature of the eggshell is a pair of dorsal appendages, which are needed for embryo respiration. Morphogenesis of this structure depends on broad, a zinc-finger transcription factor, regulated by the EGFR pathway. While much has been learned about the mechanisms of broad regulation by EGFR, current understanding of processes that shape the spatial pattern of broad expression is incomplete. We propose that this pattern is defined by two different phases of EGFR activation: an early, posterior-to-anterior gradient of EGFR signaling sets the posterior boundary of broad expression, while the anterior boundary is set by a later phase of EGFR signaling, distributed in a dorsoventral gradient. This model can explain the wild-type pattern of broad in D. melanogaster, predicts how this pattern responds to genetic perturbations, and provides insight into the mechanisms driving diversification of eggshell patterning. The proposed model of the broad expression pattern can be used as a starting point for the quantitative analysis of a large number of gene expression patterns in Drosophila oogenesis.},

abstract = {Collective cell migration, the simultaneous movement of multiple cells that are connected by cell-cell adhesion, is ubiquitous in development, tissue repair, and tumor metastasis [1, 2]. It has been hypothesized that the directionality of cell movement during collective migration emerges as a collective property [3, 4]. Here we determine how movement directionality is established in collective mesendoderm migration during zebrafish gastrulation. By interfering with two key features of collective migration, (1) having neighboring cells and (2) adhering to them, we show that individual mesendoderm cells are capable of normal directed migration when moving as single cells but require cell-cell adhesion to participate in coordinated and directed migration when moving as part of a group. We conclude that movement directionality is not a de novo collective property of mesendoderm cells but rather a property of single mesendoderm cells that requires cell-cell adhesion during collective migration.},

title = {An open access database of genome-wide association results},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is growing rapidly leading to the discovery and replication of many new disease loci. Combining results from multiple GWAS datasets may potentially strengthen previous conclusions and suggest new disease loci, pathways or pleiotropic genes. However, no database or centralized resource currently exists that contains anywhere near the full scope of GWAS results.

METHODS: We collected available results from 118 GWAS articles into a database of 56,411 significant SNP-phenotype associations and accompanying information, making this database freely available here. In doing so, we met and describe here a number of challenges to creating an open access database of GWAS results. Through preliminary analyses and characterization of available GWAS, we demonstrate the potential to gain new insights by querying a database across GWAS.

RESULTS: Using a genomic bin-based density analysis to search for highly associated regions of the genome, positive control loci (e.g., MHC loci) were detected with high sensitivity. Likewise, an analysis of highly repeated SNPs across GWAS identified replicated loci (e.g., APOE, LPL). At the same time we identified novel, highly suggestive loci for a variety of traits that did not meet genome-wide significant thresholds in prior analyses, in some cases with strong support from the primary medical genetics literature (SLC16A7, CSMD1, OAS1), suggesting these genes merit further study. Additional adjustment for linkage disequilibrium within most regions with a high density of GWAS associations did not materially alter our findings. Having a centralized database with standardized gene annotation also allowed us to examine the representation of functional gene categories (gene ontologies) containing one or more associations among top GWAS results. Genes relating to cell adhesion functions were highly over-represented among significant associations (p < 4.6 x 10(-14)), a finding which was not perturbed by a sensitivity analysis.

CONCLUSION: We provide access to a full gene-annotated GWAS database which could be used for further querying, analyses or integration with other genomic information. We make a number of general observations. Of reported associated SNPs, 40% lie within the boundaries of a RefSeq gene and 68% are within 60 kb of one, indicating a bias toward gene-centricity in the findings. We found considerable heterogeneity in information available from GWAS suggesting the wider community could benefit from standardization and centralization of results reporting.},

title = {Extracellular matrix assembly and organization during zebrafish gastrulation},
abstract = {Zebrafish gastrulation entails morphogenetic cell movements that shape the body plan and give rise to an embryo with defined anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes. Regulating these cell movements are diverse signaling pathways and proteins including Wnts, Src-family tyrosine kinases, cadherins, and matrix metalloproteinases. While our knowledge of how these proteins impact cell polarity and migration has advanced considerably in the last decade, almost no data exist regarding the organization of extracellular matrix (ECM) during zebrafish gastrulation. Here, we describe for the first time the assembly of a fibronectin (FN) and laminin containing ECM in the early zebrafish embryo. This matrix was first detected at early gastrulation (65% epiboly) in the form of punctae that localize to tissue boundaries separating germ layers from each other and the underlying yolk cell. Fibrillogenesis increased after mid-gastrulation (80% epiboly) coinciding with the period of planar cell polarity pathway-dependent convergence and extension cell movements. We demonstrate that FN fibrils present beneath deep mesodermal cells are aligned in the direction of membrane protrusion formation. Utilizing antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, we further show that knockdown of FN expression causes a convergence and extension defect. Taken together, our data show that similar to amphibian embryos, the formation of ECM in the zebrafish gastrula is a dynamic process that occurs in parallel to at least a portion of the polarized cell behaviors shaping the embryonic body plan. These results provide a framework for uncovering the interrelationship between ECM structure and cellular processes regulating convergence and extension such as directed migration and mediolateral/radial intercalation.},

title = {The role of the laminin beta subunit in laminin heterotrimer assembly and basement membrane function and development in C. elegans},
abstract = {Laminins are components of basement membranes that are required for morphogenesis, organizing cell adhesions and cell signaling. Studies have suggested that laminins function as alpha(x) beta(y) gamma(z) heterotrimers in vivo. In C. elegans, there is only one laminin beta gene, suggesting that it is required for all laminin functions. Our analysis is consistent with the role of the laminin beta as a subunit of laminin heterotrimers; the same cells express the laminin alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, the laminin beta subunit localizes to all basement membranes throughout development, and secretion of the beta subunit requires an alpha subunit. RNAi inhibition of the beta subunit gene or of the other subunit genes causes an embryonic lethality phenotype. Furthermore, a distinctive set of phenotypes is caused by both viable laminin alpha and beta partial loss-of-function mutations. These results show developmental roles for the laminin beta subunit, and they provide further genetic evidence for the importance of heterotrimer assembly in vivo.},

title = {Chiral blastomere arrangement dictates zygotic left-right asymmetry pathway in snails},
abstract = {Most animals display internal and/or external left-right asymmetry. Several mechanisms for left-right asymmetry determination have been proposed for vertebrates and invertebrates but they are still not well characterized, particularly at the early developmental stage. The gastropods Lymnaea stagnalis and the closely related Lymnaea peregra have both the sinistral (recessive) and the dextral (dominant) snails within a species and the chirality is hereditary, determined by a single locus that functions maternally. Intriguingly, the handedness-determining gene(s) and the mechanisms are not yet identified. Here we show that in L. stagnalis, the chiral blastomere arrangement at the eight-cell stage (but not the two- or four-cell stage) determines the left-right asymmetry throughout the developmental programme, and acts upstream of the Nodal signalling pathway. Thus, we could demonstrate that mechanical micromanipulation of the third cleavage chirality (from the four- to the eight-cell stage) leads to reversal of embryonic handedness. These manipulated embryos grew to 'dextralized' sinistral and 'sinistralized' dextral snails-that is, normal healthy fertile organisms with all the usual left-right asymmetries reversed to that encoded by the mothers' genetic information. Moreover, manipulation reversed the embryonic nodal expression patterns. Using backcrossed F(7) congenic animals, we could demonstrate a strong genetic linkage between the handedness-determining gene(s) and the chiral cytoskeletal dynamics at the third cleavage that promotes the dominant-type blastomere arrangement. These results establish the crucial importance of the maternally determined blastomere arrangement at the eight-cell stage in dictating zygotic signalling pathways in the organismal chiromorphogenesis. Similar chiral blastomere configuration mechanisms may also operate upstream of the Nodal pathway in left-right patterning of deuterostomes/vertebrates.},

title = {The Her7 node modulates the network topology of the zebrafish segmentation clock via sequestration of the Hes6 hub},
abstract = {Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we define a network of Her/Hes dimers underlying transcriptional negative feedback within the zebrafish segmentation clock. Some of the dimers do not appear to be DNA-binding, whereas those dimers that do interact with DNA have distinct preferences for cis regulatory sequences. Dimerization is specific, with Hes6 serving as the hub of the network. Her1 binds DNA only as a homodimer but will also dimerize with Hes6. Her12 and Her15 bind DNA both as homodimers and as heterodimers with Hes6. Her7 dimerizes strongly with Hes6 and weakly with Her15. This network structure engenders specific network dynamics and imparts greater influence to the Her7 node. Computational analysis supports the hypothesis that Her7 disproportionately influences the availability of Hes6 to heterodimerize with other Her proteins. Genetic experiments suggest that this regulation is important for operation of the network. Her7 therefore has two functions within the zebrafish segmentation clock. Her7 acts directly within the delayed negative feedback as a DNA-binding heterodimer with Hes6. Her7 also has an emergent function, independent of DNA binding, in which it modulates network topology via sequestration of the network hub.},

Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,160(3) particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

title = {Migration of zebrafish primordial germ cells: a role for myosin contraction and cytoplasmic flow},
abstract = {The molecular and cellular mechanisms governing cell motility and directed migration in response to the chemokine SDF-1 are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that zebrafish primordial germ cells whose migration is guided by SDF-1 generate bleb-like protrusions that are powered by cytoplasmic flow. Protrusions are formed at sites of higher levels of free calcium where activation of myosin contraction occurs. Separation of the acto-myosin cortex from the plasma membrane at these sites is followed by a flow of cytoplasm into the forming bleb. We propose that polarized activation of the receptor CXCR4 leads to a rise in free calcium that in turn activates myosin contraction in the part of the cell responding to higher levels of the ligand SDF-1. The biased formation of new protrusions in a particular region of the cell in response to SDF-1 defines the leading edge and the direction of cell migration.},

title = {Mechanical models for living cells--a review},
abstract = {As physical entities, living cells possess structural and physical properties that enable them to withstand the physiological environment as well as mechanical stimuli occurring within and outside the body. Any deviation from these properties will not only undermine the physical integrity of the cells, but also their biological functions. As such, a quantitative study in single cell mechanics needs to be conducted. In this review, we will examine some mechanical models that have been developed to characterize mechanical responses of living cells when subjected to both transient and dynamic loads. The mechanical models include the cortical shell-liquid core (or liquid drop) models which are widely applied to suspended cells; the solid model which is generally used for adherent cells; the power-law structural damping model which is more suited for studying the dynamic behavior of adherent cells; and finally, the biphasic model which has been widely used to study musculoskeletal cell mechanics. Based upon these models, future attempts can be made to develop even more detailed and accurate mechanical models of living cells once these three factors are adequately addressed: structural heterogeneity, appropriate constitutive relations for each of the distinct subcellular regions and components, and active forces acting within the cell. More realistic mechanical models of living cells can further contribute towards the study of mechanotransduction in cells.},

abstract = {Mammalian cells redirect their movement in response to changes in the physical properties of their extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesive scaffolds, including changes in available substrate area, shape, or flexibility. Yet, little is known about the cell's ability to discriminate between different types of spatial signals. Here we utilize a soft-lithography-based, microcontact printing technology in combination with automated computerized image analysis to explore the relationship between ECM geometry and directional motility. When fibroblast cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated adhesive islands with the same area (900 micrometers2) but different geometric forms (square, triangle, pentagon, hexagon, trapezoid, various parallelograms) and aspect ratios, cells preferentially extended new lamellipodia from their corners. In addition, by imposing these simple geometric constraints through ECM, cells were directed to deposit new fibronectin fibrils in these same corner regions. These data indicate that mammalian cells can sense edges within ECM patterns that exhibit a wide range of angularity and that they use these spatial cues to guide where they will deposit ECM and extend new motile processes during the process of directional migration.},

title = {A 3D finite element model of ventral furrow invagination in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo},
abstract = {The paper describes a mechanical model of epithelial tissue development in Drosophila embryos to investigate a buckling phenomenon called invagination. The finite element method is used to model this ventral furrow formation in 3D by decomposing the total deformation into two parts: an imposed active deformation, and an elastic passive deformation superimposed onto the latter. The model imposes as boundary conditions (i) a constant yolk volume and (ii) a sliding contact condition of the cells against the vitelline membrane, which is interpolated as a B-Spline surface. The active deformation simulates the effects of apical constriction and apico-basal elongation of cells. This set of local cellular mechanisms leads to global shape changes of the embryo which are associated with known gene expressions. Using the model we have tested different plausible hypotheses postulated to account for the mechanical behaviour of epithelial tissues. In particular, we conclude that only certain combinations of local cell shape change can successfully reproduce the invagination process. We have quantitatively compared the model with a 2D model and shown that it exhibits a more robust invagination phenomenon. The 3D model has also revealed that invagination causes a yolk flow from the central region to the anterior and posterior ends of the embryo, causing an accordion-like global compression and expansion wave to move through the embryo. Such a phenomenon cannot be described by 2D models.},

title = {Foxd3 is an essential Nodal-dependent regulator of zebrafish dorsal mesoderm development},
abstract = {Establishment of the embryonic mesoderm is dependent on integration of multiple signaling and transcriptional inputs. We report that the transcriptional regulator Foxd3 is essential for dorsal mesoderm formation in zebrafish, and that this function is dependent on the Nodal pathway. Foxd3 gain-of-function results in expanded dorsal mesodermal gene expression, including the Nodal-related gene cyclops, and body axis dorsalization. Foxd3 knockdown embryos displayed reduced expression of cyclops and mesodermal genes, axial defects similar to Nodal pathway loss-of-function, and Nodal pathway activation rescued these phenotypes. In MZoep mutants inactive for Nodal signaling, Foxd3 did not rescue mesoderm formation or axial development, indicating that the mesodermal function of Foxd3 is dependent on an active downstream Nodal pathway. A previously identified foxd3 mutant, sym1, was described as a predicted null mutation with neural crest defects, but no mesodermal or axial phenotypes. We find that Sym1 protein retains activity and can induce strong mesodermal expansion and axial dorsalization. A subset of sym1 homozygotes displays axial defects and reduced cyclops and mesodermal gene expression, and penetrance of the mesodermal phenotypes is enhanced by Foxd3 knockdown. Therefore, sym1 is a hypomorphic allele, and reduced Foxd3 function results in a reduction of cyclops expression, and subsequent mesodermal and axial defects. These results demonstrate that Foxd3 is an essential upstream regulator of the Nodal pathway in zebrafish dorsal mesoderm development and establish a broadly conserved role for Foxd3 in vertebrate mesodermal development.},

title = {Regulation of cochlear convergent extension by the vertebrate planar cell polarity pathway is dependent on p120-catenin},
abstract = {The vertebrate planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway consists of conserved PCP and ciliary genes. During development, the PCP pathway regulates convergent extension (CE) and uniform orientation of sensory hair cells in the cochlea. It is not clear how these diverse morphogenetic processes are regulated by a common set of PCP genes. Here, we show that cellular contacts and geometry change drastically and that the dynamic expression of N-cadherin and E-cadherin demarcates sharp boundaries during cochlear extension. The conditional knockout of a component of the adherens junctions, p120-catenin, leads to the reduction of E-cadherin and N-cadherin and to characteristic cochlear CE defects but not misorientation of hair cells. The specific CE defects in p120-catenin mutants are in contrast to associated CE and hair cell misorientation defects observed in common PCP gene mutants. Moreover, the loss-of-function of a conserved PCP gene, Vangl2, alters the dynamic distribution of N-cadherin and E-cadherin in the cochlea and causes similar abnormalities in cellular morphology to those found in p120-catenin mutants. Conversely, we found that Pcdh15 interacts genetically with PCP genes to regulate the formation of polar hair bundles, but not CE defects in the cochlea. Together, these results indicate that the vertebrate PCP pathway regulates CE and hair cell polarity independently and that a p120-catenin-dependent mechanism regulates CE of the cochlea.},

abstract = {A finite element model was built to simulate the dynamic behavior of soft tissues subjected to sinusoidal excitation during harmonic motion imaging. In this study, soft tissues and tissue-like phantoms were modeled as isotropic, viscoelastic, and nearly incompressible media. A 3D incompressible mixed u-p element of eight nodes, S1P0, was developed to accurately calculate the stiffness matrix for soft tissues. The finite element equations of motion were solved using the Newmark method. The Voigt description for tissue viscosity was applied to estimate the relative viscous coefficient from the phase shift between the response and excitation in a harmonic case. After validating our model via ANSYS simulation and experiments, a MATLAB finite element program was then employed to explore the effect of excitation location, viscosity, and multiple frequencies on the dynamic displacement at the frequency of interest.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provide system level explanations of developmental and physiological functions in the terms of the genomic regulatory code. Depending on their developmental functions, GRNs differ in their degree of hierarchy, and also in the types of modular sub-circuit of which they are composed, although there is a commonly employed sub-circuit repertoire. Mathematical modelling of some types of GRN sub-circuit has deepened biological understanding of the functions they mediate. The structural organization of various kinds of GRN reflects their roles in the life process, and causally illuminates both developmental and evolutionary process.},

title = {Macroscopic stiffening of embryonic tissues via microtubules, RhoGEF and the assembly of contractile bundles of actomyosin},
abstract = {During morphogenesis, forces generated by cells are coordinated and channeled by the viscoelastic properties of the embryo. Microtubules and F-actin are considered to be two of the most important structural elements within living cells accounting for both force production and mechanical stiffness. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of microtubules to the stiffness of converging and extending dorsal tissues in Xenopus laevis embryos using cell biological, biophysical and embryological techniques. Surprisingly, we discovered that depolymerizing microtubules stiffens embryonic tissues by three- to fourfold. We attribute tissue stiffening to Xlfc, a previously identified RhoGEF, which binds microtubules and regulates the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Combining drug treatments and Xlfc activation and knockdown lead us to the conclusion that mechanical properties of tissues such as viscoelasticity can be regulated through RhoGTPase pathways and rule out a direct contribution of microtubules to tissue stiffness in the frog embryo. We can rescue nocodazole-induced stiffening with drugs that reduce actomyosin contractility and can partially rescue morphogenetic defects that affect stiffened embryos. We support these conclusions with a multi-scale analysis of cytoskeletal dynamics, tissue-scale traction and measurements of tissue stiffness to separate the role of microtubules from RhoGEF activation. These findings suggest a re-evaluation of the effects of nocodazole and increased focus on the role of Rho family GTPases as regulators of the mechanical properties of cells and their mechanical interactions with surrounding tissues.},

title = {Marker selection for genetic case-control association studies},
abstract = {Association studies can focus on candidate gene(s), a particular genomic region, or adopt a genome-wide association approach, each of which has implications for marker selection. The strategy for marker selection will affect the statistical power of the study to detect a disease association and is a crucial element of study design. The abundant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the markers of choice in genetic case-control association studies. The genotypes of neighboring SNPs are often highly correlated ('in linkage disequilibrium', LD) within a population, which is utilized for selecting specific 'tagSNPs' to serve as proxies for other nearby SNPs in high LD. General guidelines for SNP selection in candidate genes/regions and genome-wide studies are provided in this protocol, along with illustrative examples. Publicly available web-based resources are utilized to browse and retrieve data, and software, such as Haploview and Goldsurfer2, is applied to investigate LD and to select tagSNPs.},

The existence of morphogens during mesoderm induction and patterning in vertebrates has been highly controversial, and it remains unknown whether endogenous mesoderm inducers act directly as morphogens, function locally or act through relay mechanisms. Here we test the morphogen properties of Cyclops and Squint-two Nodal-related transforming growth factor-beta signals required for mesoderm formation and patterning in zebrafish. Whereas different levels of both Squint and Cyclops can induce different downstream genes, we find that only Squint can function directly at a distance. These results indicate that Squint acts as a secreted morphogen that does not require a relay mechanism.},

abstract = {Morphogenesis takes place against a background of organism-to-organism and environmental variation. Therefore, fundamental questions in the study of morphogenesis include: How are the mechanical processes of tissue movement and deformation affected by that variability, and in turn, how do the mechanic of the system modulate phenotypic variation? We highlight a few key factors, including environmental temperature, embryo size and environmental chemistry that might perturb the mechanics of morphogenesis in natural populations. Then we discuss several ways in which mechanics-including feedback from mechanical cues-might influence intra-specific variation in morphogenesis. To understand morphogenesis it will be necessary to consider whole-organism, environment and evolutionary scales because these larger scales present the challenges that developmental mechanisms have evolved to cope with. Studying the variation organisms express and the variation organisms experience will aid in deciphering the causes of birth defects.},

abstract = {The Sp family of transcription factors is required for the expression of cell cycle- and developmentally regulated genes, and the deregulated expression of a handful of family members is associated with human tumorigenesis. Sp2 is a relatively poorly characterized member of the Sp family that, although widely expressed, exhibits little or no DNA binding or transcriptional activity in human and mouse cell lines. To begin to address the role(s) played by Sp2 in early metazoan development we have cloned and characterized Sp2 from zebrafish (Danio rerio). We report that 1) the intron/exon organization and amino acid sequence of zebrafish Sp2 is closely conserved with its mammalian orthologues, 2) zebrafish Sp2 weakly stimulates an Sp-dependent promoter in vitro and associates with the nuclear matrix in a DNA-independent fashion, 3) zebrafish Sp2 is inherited as a maternal transcript, is transcribed in zebrafish embryos and adult tissues, and is required for completion of gastrulation, and 4) zebrafish lines carrying transgenes regulated by the Sp2 promoter recapitulate patterns of endogenous Sp2 expression.},

title = {Chromatin states of developmentally-regulated genes revealed by DNA and histone methylation patterns in zebrafish embryos},
abstract = {Embryo development proceeds from a cascade of gene activation and repression events controlled by epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones. Little is known about epigenetic states in the developing zebrafish, despite its importance as a model organism. We report here DNA methylation and histone modification profiles of promoters of developmentally-regulated genes (pou5f1, sox2, sox3, klf4, nnr, otx1b, nes, vasa), as well as tert and bactin2, in zebrafish embryos at the mid-late blastula transition, shortly after embryonic genome activation. We identify four classes of promoters based on the following profiles: (i) those enriched in marks of active genes (H3K9ac, H4ac, H3K4me3) without transcriptionally repressing H3K9me3 or H3K27me3; (ii) those enriched in H3K9ac, H4ac and H3K27me3, without H3K9me3; one such gene was klf4, shown by in situ hybridization to be mosaically expressed, likely accounting for the detection of both activating and repressive marks on its promoter; (iii) those enriched in H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 without acetylation; and (iv) those enriched in all histone modifications examined. Culture of embryo-derived cells under differentiation conditions leads to H3K9 and H4 deacetylation and H3K9 and H3K27 trimethylation on genes that are inactivated, yielding an epigenetic profile similar to those of fibroblasts or muscle. All promoters however retain H3K4me3, indicating an uncoupling of H3K4me3 occupancy and gene expression. All non-CpG island developmentally-regulated promoters are DNA unmethylated in embryos, but hypermethylated in fibroblasts. Our results suggest that differentially expressed embryonic genes are regulated by various patterns of histone modifications on unmethylated DNA, which create a developmentally permissive chromatin state.},

title = {Diffusion, crowding {\&} protein stability in a dynamic molecular model of the bacterial cytoplasm},
abstract = {A longstanding question in molecular biology is the extent to which the behavior of macromolecules observed in vitro accurately reflects their behavior in vivo. A number of sophisticated experimental techniques now allow the behavior of individual types of macromolecule to be studied directly in vivo; none, however, allow a wide range of molecule types to be observed simultaneously. In order to tackle this issue we have adopted a computational perspective, and, having selected the model prokaryote Escherichia coli as a test system, have assembled an atomically detailed model of its cytoplasmic environment that includes 50 of the most abundant types of macromolecules at experimentally measured concentrations. Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of the cytoplasm model have been calibrated to reproduce the translational diffusion coefficients of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) observed in vivo, and "snapshots" of the simulation trajectories have been used to compute the cytoplasm's effects on the thermodynamics of protein folding, association and aggregation events. The simulation model successfully describes the relative thermodynamic stabilities of proteins measured in E. coli, and shows that effects additional to the commonly cited "crowding" effect must be included in attempts to understand macromolecular behavior in vivo.},

abstract = {Animal tissue and organ development requires the orchestration of cell movements, including those of interconnected cell groups, termed collective cell movements. Such movements are incredibly diverse. Recent work suggests that two core cellular properties, cell-cell adhesion and contractility, can largely determine geometry, packing, sorting, and rearrangement of epithelial cell layers. Two additional force-generating properties, the ability to generate cell protrusions and cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, contribute to active motility. These mechanical properties can be regulated independently in cells, suggesting that they can be employed in a combinatorial manner. A small number of properties used in combination could, in principle, generate a diverse array of cell shapes and arrangements and thus orchestrate the varied morphogenetic events observed during metazoan organ development.},

abstract = {Mesoderm invagination, the first morphogenetic movement of gastrulation in the early Drososphila embryo, is controlled by the expression of the twist and snail genes. Our knowledge concerning epistatic relationships between these genes implies the existence of a poorly understood biochemical maintenance of twist expression during mesoderm invagination by the snail gene. In the light of a review detailing the role of these genes in the cell shape changes leading to invagination, and of recent findings showing the expression of twist as mechanically sensitive, we suggest that the expression of twist in the mesoderm could alternatively be maintained by mechanical strains developed during mesoderm invagination.},

title = {A three-dimensional vertex dynamics cell model of space-filling polyhedra simulating cell behavior in a cell aggregate},
abstract = {We developed a three-dimensional (3D) cell model of a multicellular aggregate consisting of several polyhedral cells to investigate the deformation and rearrangement of cells under the influence of external forces. The polyhedral cells fill the space in the aggregate without gaps or overlaps, consist of contracting interfaces and maintain their volumes. The interfaces and volumes were expressed by 3D vertex coordinates. Vertex movements obey equations of motion that rearrange the cells to minimize total free energy, and undergo an elementary process that exchanges vertex pair connections when vertices approach each other. The total free energy includes the interface energy of cells and the compression or expansion energy of cells. Computer simulations provided the following results: An aggregate of cells becomes spherical to minimize individual cell surface areas; Polygonal interfaces of cells remain flat; Cells within the 3D cell aggregate can move and rearrange despite the absence of free space. We examined cell rearrangement to elucidate the viscoelastic properties of the aggregate, e.g. when an external force flattens a cell aggregate (e.g. under centrifugation) its component cells quickly flatten. Under a continuous external force, the cells slowly rearrange to recover their original shape although the cell aggregate remains flat. The deformation and rearrangement of individual cells is a two-step process with a time lag. Our results showed that morphological and viscoelastic properties of the cell aggregate with long relaxation time are based on component cells where minimization of interfacial energy of cells provides a motive force for cell movement.},

Our approach is based on the description of the length and attachment dynamics of actin filaments in the lamellipodium network. It is used to determine the total force exerted on the membrane at each position along the leading edge and at each time step. The model reproduces the marked state switches in protrusion morphodynamics found experimentally between epithelial cells in control conditions and cells expressing constitutively active Rac, a signaling molecule involved in the regulation of lamellipodium network assembly. The model also suggests a mechanistic explanation of experimental distortions in protrusion morphodynamics induced by deregulation of Arp2/3 and cofilin activity.},

abstract = {The response of cells to forces is essential for tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. This response has been extensively investigated in interphase cells, but it remains unclear how forces affect dividing cells. We used a combination of micro-manipulation tools on human dividing cells to address the role of physical parameters of the micro-environment in controlling the cell division axis, a key element of tissue morphogenesis. We found that forces applied on the cell body direct spindle orientation during mitosis. We further show that external constraints induce a polarization of dynamic subcortical actin structures that correlate with spindle movements. We propose that cells divide according to cues provided by their mechanical micro-environment, aligning daughter cells with the external force field.},

abstract = {Directed cell migration is critical for tissue morphogenesis and wound healing, but the mechanism of directional control is poorly understood. Here we show that the direction in which cells extend their leading edge can be controlled by constraining cell shape using micrometer-sized extracellular matrix (ECM) islands. When cultured on square ECM islands in the presence of motility factors, cells preferentially extended lamellipodia, filopodia, and microspikes from their corners. Square cells reoriented their stress fibers and focal adhesions so that tractional forces were concentrated in these corner regions. When cell tension was dissipated, lamellipodia extension ceased. Mechanical interactions between cells and ECM that modulate cytoskeletal tension may therefore play a key role in the control of directional cell motility.},

abstract = {Organ formation requires the precise assembly of progenitor cells into a functional multicellular structure. Mechanical forces probably participate in this process but how they influence organ morphogenesis is still unclear. Here, we show that Wnt11- and Prickle1a-mediated planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling coordinates the formation of the zebrafish ciliated laterality organ (Kupffer's vesicle) by regulating adhesion properties between organ progenitor cells (the dorsal forerunner cells, DFCs). Combined inhibition of Wnt11 and Prickle1a reduces DFC cell-cell adhesion and impairs their compaction and arrangement during vesicle lumen formation. This leads to the formation of a mis-shapen vesicle with small fragmented lumina and shortened cilia, resulting in severely impaired organ function and, as a consequence, randomised laterality of both molecular and visceral asymmetries. Our results reveal a novel role for PCP-dependent cell adhesion in coordinating the supracellular organisation of progenitor cells during vertebrate laterality organ formation.},

title = {Analysis of gap gene regulation in a 3D organism-scale model of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo},
abstract = {The axial bodyplan of Drosophila melanogaster is determined during a process called morphogenesis. Shortly after fertilization, maternal bicoid mRNA is translated into Bicoid (Bcd). This protein establishes a spatially graded morphogen distribution along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the embryo. Bcd initiates AP axis determination by triggering expression of gap genes that subsequently regulate each other's expression to form a precisely controlled spatial distribution of gene products. Reaction-diffusion models of gap gene expression on a 1D domain have previously been used to infer complex genetic regulatory network (GRN) interactions by optimizing model parameters with respect to 1D gap gene expression data. Here we construct a finite element reaction-diffusion model with a realistic 3D geometry fit to full 3D gap gene expression data. Though gap gene products exhibit dorsal-ventral asymmetries, we discover that previously inferred gap GRNs yield qualitatively correct AP distributions on the 3D domain only when DV-symmetric initial conditions are employed. Model patterning loses qualitative agreement with experimental data when we incorporate a realistic DV-asymmetric distribution of Bcd. Further, we find that geometry alone is insufficient to account for DV-asymmetries in the final gap gene distribution. Additional GRN optimization confirms that the 3D model remains sensitive to GRN parameter perturbations. Finally, we find that incorporation of 3D data in simulation and optimization does not constrain the search space or improve optimization results.},

Most work on cell proliferation focuses on elucidating the signaling pathways responsible for control of cell cycle progression that are triggered by cell binding to soluble growth factors and insoluble extracellular matrix. Here we review recent work, which has revealed that mechanical tension-dependent changes in cell shape and cytoskeletal structure are equally critical for control of growth, as well as cell fate switching. This interplay between soluble, insoluble, and mechanical cues helps to explain how cell behaviors responsible for tissue formation are controlled in the physical context of living tissues.},

title = {Hopf bifurcation in the presomitic mesoderm during the mouse segmentation},
abstract = {Vertebrae and ribs arise from embryonic tissues called somites. Somites arise sequentially from the unsegmented embryo tail, called presomitic mesoderm (PSM). The pace of somite formation is controlled by gene products such as hairy and enhancer of split 7 (Hes7) whose expression oscillates in the PSM. In addition to the cyclic genes, there is a gradient of fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) mRNA from posterior to anterior PSM. Recent experiments have shown that in the absence of Fgf signaling, Hes7 oscillations in the anterior and posterior PSM are lost. On the other hand, Notch mutants reduce the amplitude of posterior Hes7 oscillations and abolish anterior Hes7 oscillations. To understand these phenotypes, we delineated and simulated a logical and a delay differential equation (DDE) model with similar network topology in wild-type and mutant situations. Both models reproduced most wild-type and mutant phenotypes suggesting that the chosen topology is robust to explain these phenotypes. Numerical continuation of the model showed that even in the wild-type situation, the system changed from sustained to damped, i.e. a Hopf bifurcation occurred, when the Fgf concentration decreased in the PSM. This numerical continuation analysis further indicated that the most sensitive parameters for the oscillations are the parameters of Hes7 followed by those of Lunatic fringe (Lfng) and Notch1. In the wild-type, the damping of Hes7 oscillations was not so strong so that cells reached the new somites before they lose Hes7 oscillations. By contrast, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1) conditional knock-out (cKO) mutant simulation, Notch signaling was not able to maintain sustained Hes7 oscillations. Our analysis suggests that Fgf signaling makes cells enter an oscillatory state of Hes7 expression. After moving to the anterior PSM, where Fgf signaling is missing, Notch signaling compensates the damping of Hes7 oscillations in the anterior PSM.},

title = {Gene regulatory networks and the evolution of animal body plans},
abstract = {Development of the animal body plan is controlled by large gene regulatory networks (GRNs), and hence evolution of body plans must depend upon change in the architecture of developmental GRNs. However, these networks are composed of diverse components that evolve at different rates and in different ways. Because of the hierarchical organization of developmental GRNs, some kinds of change affect terminal properties of the body plan such as occur in speciation, whereas others affect major aspects of body plan morphology. A notable feature of the paleontological record of animal evolution is the establishment by the Early "Cambrian of virtually all phylum-level body plans. We identify a class of GRN component, the kernels" of the network, which, because of their developmental role and their particular internal structure, are most impervious to change. Conservation of phyletic body plans may have been due to the retention since pre-Cambrian time of GRN kernels, which underlie development of major body parts.},

title = {Regulation of convergence and extension movements during vertebrate gastrulation by the Wnt/PCP pathway},
abstract = {Vertebrate gastrulation entails massive cell movements that establish and shape the germ layers. During gastrulation, the individual cell behaviors are strictly coordinated in time and space by various signaling pathways. These pathways instruct the cells about proliferation, shape, fate and migration into proper location. Convergence and extension (C{\&}E) movements during vertebrate gastrulation play a major role in the shaping of the embryonic body. In vertebrates, the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (Wnt/PCP) pathway is a key regulator of C{\&}E movements, essential for several polarized cell behaviors, including directed cell migration, and mediolateral and radial cell intercalation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of Planar Cell Polarity by highly dynamic mesenchymal cells engaged in C{\&}E are still not well understood. Here we review new evidence implicating the Wnt/PCP pathway in specific cell behaviors required for C{\&}E during zebrafish gastrulation, in comparison to other vertebrates. We also discuss findings on the molecular regulation and the interaction of the Wnt/PCP pathway with other signaling pathways during gastrulation movements.},

abstract = {The correlation between cell shape elongation and the orientation of the division axis described by early cell biologists is still used as a paradigm in developmental studies. However, analysis of early embryo development and tissue morphogenesis has highlighted the role of the spatial distribution of cortical cues able to guide spindle orientation. In vitro studies of cell division have revealed similar mechanisms. Recent data support the possibility that the orientation of cell division in mammalian cells is dominated by cell adhesion and the associated traction forces developed in interphase. Cell shape is a manifestation of these adhesive and tensional patterns. These patterns control the spatial distribution of cortical signals and thereby guide spindle orientation and daughter cell positioning. From these data, cell division appears to be a continuous transformation ensuring the maintenance of tissue mechanical integrity.},

abstract = {Because of the resemblance of many epithelial tissues to densely packed soap bubbles, it has been suggested that surface minimization, which drives soap bubble packing, could be governing cell packing as well. We test this by modeling the shape of the cells in a Drosophila retina ommatidium. We use the observed configurations and shapes in wild-type flies, as well as in flies with different numbers of cells per ommatidia, and mutants with cells where E- or N-cadherin is either deleted or misexpressed. We find that surface minimization is insufficient to model the experimentally observed shapes and packing of the cells based on their cadherin expression. We then consider a model in which adhesion leads to a surface increase, balanced by cell cortex contraction. Using the experimentally observed distributions of E- and N-cadherin, we simulate the packing and cell shapes in the wild-type eye. Furthermore, by changing only the corresponding parameters, this model can describe the mutants with different numbers of cells or changes in cadherin expression.},

Among 116,204 single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped, an intronic and common variant in the complement factor H gene (CFH) is strongly associated with AMD (nominal P value <10(-7)). In individuals homozygous for the risk allele, the likelihood of AMD is increased by a factor of 7.4 (95% confidence interval 2.9 to 19). Resequencing revealed a polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with the risk allele representing a tyrosine-histidine change at amino acid 402. This polymorphism is in a region of CFH that binds heparin and C-reactive protein. The CFH gene is located on chromosome 1 in a region repeatedly linked to AMD in family-based studies.},

title = {When it pays to rush: interpreting morphogen gradients prior to steady-state},
abstract = {During development, morphogen gradients precisely determine the position of gene expression boundaries despite the inevitable presence of fluctuations. Recent experiments suggest that some morphogen gradients may be interpreted prior to reaching steady-state. Theoretical work has predicted that such systems will be more robust to embryo-to-embryo fluctuations. By analyzing two experimentally motivated models of morphogen gradient formation, we investigate the positional precision of gene expression boundaries determined by pre-steady-state morphogen gradients in the presence of embryo-to-embryo fluctuations, internal biochemical noise and variations in the timing of morphogen measurement. Morphogens that are direct transcription factors are found to be particularly sensitive to internal noise when interpreted prior to steady-state, disadvantaging early measurement, even in the presence of large embryo-to-embryo fluctuations. Morphogens interpreted by cell-surface receptors can be measured prior to steady-state without significant decrease in positional precision provided fluctuations in the timing of measurement are small. Applying our results to experiment, we predict that Bicoid, a transcription factor morphogen in Drosophila, is unlikely to be interpreted prior to reaching steady-state. We also predict that Activin in Xenopus and Nodal in zebrafish, morphogens interpreted by cell-surface receptors, can be decoded in pre-steady-state.},

abstract = {We introduce a model for describing the dynamics of large num-

subcellular elements, which interact with each other through phenomenological 
intra- and intercellular potentials. Advantages of the model include i) adap- 
tive cell-shape dynamics, ii) flexible accommodation of additional intracellular 
biology, and iii) the absence of an underlying grid. We present here a de- 
tailed description of the model, and use successive mean-field approximations 
to connect it to more coarse-grained approaches, such as discrete cell-based 
algorithms and coupled partial differential equations. We also discuss efficient 
algorithms for encoding the model, and give an example of a simulation of an 
epithelial sheet. Given the biological flexibility of the model, we propose that 
it can be used effectively for modeling a range of multicellular processes, such 
as tumor dynamics and embryogenesis. },

title = {miRNA regulation of Sdf1 chemokine signaling provides genetic robustness to germ cell migration},
abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) function as genetic rheostats to control gene output. Based on their role as modulators, it has been postulated that miRNAs canalize development and provide genetic robustness. Here, we uncover a previously unidentified regulatory layer of chemokine signaling by miRNAs that confers genetic robustness on primordial germ cell (PGC) migration. In zebrafish, PGCs are guided to the gonad by the ligand Sdf1a, which is regulated by the sequestration receptor Cxcr7b. We find that miR-430 regulates sdf1a and cxcr7 mRNAs. Using target protectors, we demonstrate that miR-430-mediated regulation of endogenous sdf1a (also known as cxcl12a) and cxcr7b (i) facilitates dynamic expression of sdf1a by clearing its mRNA from previous expression domains, (ii) modulates the levels of the decoy receptor Cxcr7b to avoid excessive depletion of Sdf1a and (iii) buffers against variation in gene dosage of chemokine signaling components to ensure accurate PGC migration. Our results indicate that losing miRNA-mediated regulation can expose otherwise buffered genetic lesions leading to developmental defects.},

title = {Directional decisions during neutrophil chemotaxis inside bifurcating channels},
abstract = {The directional migration of human neutrophils in classical chemotaxis assays is often described as a "biased random walk" implying significant randomness in speed and directionality. However, these experiments are inconsistent with in vivo observations, where neutrophils can navigate effectively through complex tissue microenvironments towards their targets. Here, we demonstrate a novel biomimetic assay for neutrophil chemotaxis using enclosed microfluidic channels. Remarkably, under these enclosed conditions, neutrophils recapitulate the highly robust and efficient navigation observed in vivo. In straight channels, neutrophils undergo sustained, unidirectional motion towards a chemoattractant source. In more complex maze-like geometries, neutrophils are able to select the most direct route over 90% of the time. Finally, at symmetric bifurcations, neutrophils split their leading edge into two sections and a "tug of war" ensues. The competition between the two new leading edges is ultimately resolved by stochastic, symmetry-breaking behavior. This behavior is suggestive of directional decision-making localized at the leading edge and a signaling role played by the cellular cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {Genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) are complex, large-scale, and spatially and temporally distributed. These characteristics impose challenging demands on software tools for building GRN models, and so there is a need for custom tools. In this paper, we report on our ongoing development of BioTapestry, an open source, freely available computational tool designed specifically for building GRN models. We also outline our future development plans, and give some examples of current applications of BioTapestry.},

title = {Zebrafish aplnra functions in epiboly},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The zebrafish, Danio rerio, possesses the paralogous genes aplnra and aplnrb that are duplicates of an ancestral orthologue of the human APLNR gene encoding a G-protein coupled receptor that binds the peptide ligand APELIN and is required for normal cardiovascular function. aplnrb is required for migration of cells contributing to heart development in zebrafish embryos. aplnra is transcribed in a complex pattern during early development but its function in embryogenesis is largely unknown. FINDINGS: Blockage of translation of aplnra mRNA in zebrafish embryos results in retarded or failed epiboly with the blastoderm apparently disconnected from the nuclei of the yolk syncytial layer. Gastrulation is also defective. Failure of correct tail extension is observed with ectopic structures resembling somites positioned dorsal to the spinal cord. CONCLUSION: aplnra, unlike its duplicate aplnrb, is essential for normal epiboly, although this function appears to be independent of signalling activated by zebrafish Apelin. The defects in epiboly caused by loss of aplnra activity appear, at least partially, to be due to a requirement for aplnra activity in the yolk syncytial layer.},

Zygotic transcription starts at the end of gastrulation anteriorly in the presumptive neurectoderm and in the presomitic mesoderm. During somitogenesis expression is detected in developing central nervous system, including forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain and spinal cord, the lateral mesoderm and the anterior part of the forming somites. The strong sequence conservation of fz7 to the mouse, chick and Xenopus counterparts is also true for their expression pattern.},

title = {Multiscale mechanisms of cell migration during development: theory and experiment},
abstract = {Long-distance cell migration is an important feature of embryonic development, adult morphogenesis and cancer, yet the mechanisms that drive subpopulations of cells to distinct targets are poorly understood. Here, we use the embryonic neural crest (NC) in tandem with theoretical studies to evaluate model mechanisms of long-distance cell migration. We find that a simple chemotaxis model is insufficient to explain our experimental data. Instead, model simulations predict that NC cell migration requires leading cells to respond to long-range guidance signals and trailing cells to short-range cues in order to maintain a directed, multicellular stream. Experiments confirm differences in leading versus trailing NC cell subpopulations, manifested in unique cell orientation and gene expression patterns that respond to non-linear tissue growth of the migratory domain. Ablation experiments that delete the trailing NC cell subpopulation reveal that leading NC cells distribute all along the migratory pathway and develop a leading/trailing cellular orientation and gene expression profile that is predicted by model simulations. Transplantation experiments and model predictions that move trailing NC cells to the migratory front, or vice versa, reveal that cells adopt a gene expression profile and cell behaviors corresponding to the new position within the migratory stream. These results offer a mechanistic model in which leading cells create and respond to a cell-induced chemotactic gradient and transmit guidance information to trailing cells that use short-range signals to move in a directional manner.},

title = {A network biology approach to aging in yeast},
abstract = {In this study, a reverse-engineering strategy was used to infer and analyze the structure and function of an aging and glucose repressed gene regulatory network in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The method uses transcriptional perturbations to model the functional interactions between genes as a system of first-order ordinary differential equations. The resulting network model correctly identified the known interactions of key regulators in a 10-gene network from the Snf1 signaling pathway, which is required for expression of glucose-repressed genes upon calorie restriction. The majority of interactions predicted by the network model were confirmed using promoter-reporter gene fusions in gene-deletion mutants and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, revealing a more complex network architecture than previously appreciated. The reverse-engineered network model also predicted an unexpected role for transcriptional regulation of the SNF1 gene by hexose kinase enzyme/transcriptional repressor Hxk2, Mediator subunit Med8, and transcriptional repressor Mig1. These interactions were validated experimentally and used to design new experiments demonstrating Snf1 and its transcriptional regulators Hxk2 and Mig1 as modulators of chronological lifespan. This work demonstrates the value of using network inference methods to identify and characterize the regulators of complex phenotypes, such as aging.},

title = {Collective cell migration in development},
abstract = {Collective cell migration is a key process during the development of most organisms. It can involve either the migration of closely packed mesenchymal cells that make dynamic contacts with frequently changing neighbour cells, or the migration of epithelial sheets that typically display more stable cell-cell interactions and less frequent changes in neighbours. These collective movements can be controlled by short- or long-range dynamic gradients of extracellular signalling molecules, depending on the number of cells involved and their distance of migration. These gradients are sensed by some or all of the migrating cells and translated into directed migration, which in many settings is further modulated by cell-contact-mediated attractive or repulsive interactions that result in contact-following or contact-inhibition of locomotion, respectively. Studies of collective migration of groups of epithelial cells during development indicate that, in some cases, only leader cells sense and migrate up an external signal gradient, and that adjacent cells follow through strong cell-cell contacts. In this Commentary, I review studies of collective cell migration of differently sized cell populations during the development of several model organisms, and discuss our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that coordinate this migration.},

Unlike synthetic polymer networks, the cell cytoskeleton is a highly dynamical system due to the on-off kinetics of the crosslinking proteins and the polymerization--depolymerization cycles of the filaments themselves. More remarkably, some of the crosslinkers are motor proteins, which are capable of generating forces and directional motion between the filaments by consuming chemical energy. Thus, the cell cytoskeleton is a highly complex and active polymer gel, which is responsible for the unique cell mechanical properties, which make it crawl, divide and assemble to higher functional units. This complexity of the cytoskeleton demands the development of novel experimental techniques as well as theoretical ideas. This review will deal with the recent technological, experimental and theoretical developments in the field of cell mechanics, and current trends. It will be shown that despite the cytoskeletal complexity, cells show some very general rheological properties.},

title = {Fgf8 morphogen gradient forms by a source-sink mechanism with freely diffusing molecules},
abstract = {It is widely accepted that tissue differentiation and morphogenesis in multicellular organisms are regulated by tightly controlled concentration gradients of morphogens. How exactly these gradients are formed, however, remains unclear. Here we show that Fgf8 morphogen gradients in living zebrafish embryos are established and maintained by two essential factors: fast, free diffusion of single molecules away from the source through extracellular space, and a sink function of the receiving cells, regulated by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Evidence is provided by directly examining single molecules of Fgf8 in living tissue by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, quantifying their local mobility and concentration with high precision. By changing the degree of uptake of Fgf8 into its target cells, we are able to alter the shape of the Fgf8 gradient. Our results demonstrate that a freely diffusing morphogen can set up concentration gradients in a complex multicellular tissue by a simple source-sink mechanism.},

abstract = {The yolk syncytial layer (YSL) plays crucial roles in early zebrafish development. The YSL is a transient extra-embryonic syncytial tissue that forms during early cleavage stages and persists until larval stages. During gastrulation, the YSL undergoes highly dynamic movements, which are tightly coordinated with the movements of the overlying germ layer progenitor cells, and has critical functions in cell fate specification and morphogenesis of the early germ layers. Movement coordination between the YSL and blastoderm cells is dependent on contact between these tissues, and is probably required for the patterning and morphogenetic function of the YSL. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the YSL morphogenesis and movement coordination between the YSL and blastoderm during early development.},

title = {Structural components and morphogenetic mechanics of the zebrafish yolk extension, a developmental module},
abstract = {The yolk extension (YE) appears to be a novel developmental module that has been inserted into the phylotypic period of teleostean development, specifically in the order Cypriniformes. The zebrafish YE informs the study of morphogenetic movements reshaping ventral tissues because (1) this trait is easily visible, so disruptions are easy to score; (2) its ontogenesis occurs quickly; and (3) the yolk cell isolates the tissues elongating the ventrum from the rest of the embryo, serving as a three-dimensional in vivo "tissue culture." We determined that three histological compartments comprise the structural components of the YE: (1) the internal yolk cell; (2) the mesendodermal mantle external to the yolk cell; and (3) the external embryonic integument, consisting of an embryonic epidermis plus enveloping layer cells. These structural components interact with one another in a hierarchical manner, resulting in the morphogenesis of the elongated and tubular embryonic zebrafish ventrum as the cylindrical YE forms. Time-lapse videomicroscopy and experimental manipulation show that the yolk mass is a cohesive, viscoelastic foam, which resists compression. Moreover, as the mesodermal mantle participates in tubulation of the posterior trunk, Kupffer's Vesicle, the organ of laterality in teleosts, separates from the posterior pole of the yolk syncytial layer. Additionally, the embryonic integument becomes contractile over the posterior yolk cell, constricting the yolk mass to form the YE. These findings constitute an initial assessment of the morphogenetic mechanics underlying formation of the YE developmental module in zebrafish.},

abstract = {In multicellular organisms, cells pack together to form tissues of intricate and well defined morphology. How such cell-packing geometries arise is an important open question in biology, because the functionality of many differentiated tissues depends on their reliable formation. We show that combining adhesive forces due to E- and N-cadherin with a quantitative description of cell membrane elasticity in an interfacial energy model explains not only the qualitative neighbor relations, but also the detailed geometry of a tissue. The characteristic cellular geometries in the eyes of both wild-type Drosophila and genetic mutants are accurately reproduced by using a fixed set of few, physically motivated parameters. The model predicts adhesion strengths in the eye epithelium, quantifies their role relative to membrane elasticity, and reveals how simple minimization of interfacial energy can give rise to complex geometric patterns of important biological functionality.},

title = {Delta-promoted filopodia mediate long-range lateral inhibition in Drosophila},
abstract = {Drosophila thoracic mechanosensory bristles originate from cells that are singled out from 'proneural' groups of competent epithelial cells. Neural competence is restricted to individual sensory organ precursors (SOPs) by Delta/Notch-mediated 'lateral inhibition', whereas other cells in the proneural field adopt an epidermal fate. The precursors of the large macrochaetes differentiate separately from individual proneural clusters that comprise about 20-30 cells or as heterochronic pairs from groups of more than 100 cells, whereas the precursors of the small regularly spaced microchaetes emerge from even larger proneural fields. This indicates that lateral inhibition might act over several cell diameters; it was difficult to reconcile with the fact that the inhibitory ligand Delta is membrane-bound until the observation that SOPs frequently extend thin processes offered an attractive hypothesis. Here we show that the extension of these planar filopodia--a common attribute of wing imaginal disc cells--is promoted by Delta and that their experimental suppression reduces Notch signalling in distant cells and increases bristle density in large proneural groups, showing that these membrane specializations mediate long-range lateral inhibition.},

title = {Statistical methods for gene set co-expression analysis},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: The power of a microarray experiment derives from the identification of genes differentially regulated across biological conditions. To date, differential regulation is most often taken to mean differential expression, and a number of useful methods for identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes or gene sets are available. However, such methods are not able to identify many relevant classes of differentially regulated genes. One important example concerns differentially co-expressed (DC) genes.

RESULTS: We propose an approach, gene set co-expression analysis (GSCA), to identify DC gene sets. The GSCA approach provides a false discovery rate controlled list of interesting gene sets, does not require that genes be highly correlated in at least one biological condition and is readily applied to data from individual or multiple experiments, as we demonstrate using data from studies of lung cancer and diabetes.

AVAILABILITY: The GSCA approach is implemented in R and available at www.biostat.wisc.edu/ approximately kendzior/GSCA/.

abstract = {In this paper we present a computational tool that enables the simulation of mathematical models of cell migration and chemotaxis on an evolving cell membrane. Recent models require the numerical solution of systems of reaction-diffusion equations on the evolving cell membrane and then the solution state is used to drive the evolution of the cell edge. Previous work involved moving the cell edge using a level set method (LSM). However, the LSM is computationally very expensive, which severely limits the practical usefulness of the algorithm. To address this issue, we have employed the parameterised finite element method (PFEM) as an alternative method for evolving a cell boundary. We show that the PFEM is far more efficient and robust than the LSM. We therefore suggest that the PFEM potentially has an essential role to play in computational modelling efforts towards the understanding of many of the complex issues related to chemotaxis.},

The extra-embryonic yolk syncytial layer (YSL) tows the blastoderm vegetally during epiboly by means of its tight junction attachments to the enveloping layer (EVL). Claudins are the major transmembrane protein components of tight junctions. Here, we focus on the function of Claudin E (Cldne), which is expressed specifically in the EVL. Morpholino knock-down of cldne produced a highly penetrant epiboly delay. Our analysis suggested that the EVL margin, which is attached to the YSL, was under reduced tension in morphant embryos. We propose that local variation in the strength of EVL-YSL attachment in morphant embryos resulted in slow and uneven advancement of the EVL and blastoderm. Our work is the first to demonstrate that Claudins are important for zebrafish epiboly.},

title = {A gene network model accounting for development and evolution of mammalian teeth},
abstract = {Generation of morphological diversity remains a challenge for evolutionary biologists because it is unclear how an ultimately finite number of genes involved in initial pattern formation integrates with morphogenesis. Ideally, models used to search for the simplest developmental principles on how genes produce form should account for both developmental process and evolutionary change. Here we present a model reproducing the morphology of mammalian teeth by integrating experimental data on gene interactions and growth into a morphodynamic mechanism in which developing morphology has a causal role in patterning. The model predicts the course of tooth-shape development in different mammalian species and also reproduces key transitions in evolution. Furthermore, we reproduce the known expression patterns of several genes involved in tooth development and their dynamics over developmental time. Large morphological effects frequently can be achieved by small changes, according to this model, and similar morphologies can be produced by different changes. This finding may be consistent with why predicting the morphological outcomes of molecular experiments is challenging. Nevertheless, models incorporating morphology and gene activity show promise for linking genotypes to phenotypes.},

It complements conventional (FM), confocal (CFM), and two-photon fluorescence microscopy (2hnu-FM) currently used in modern life sciences. Lateral and axial SPIM point spread function (PSF) extents are measured by using fluorescent beads to determine the 3D resolution. The results are compared with values derived from an analytical theory and numerical simulations. The discrepancies are found to be less than 5%. The axial extent of a SPIM-PSF (10x/0.3 W) is approximately 5.7 microm. This value is almost a factor of 2 smaller than in CFM, more than 2.5 times smaller than in FM, and more than three times smaller than in 2hnu-FM. SPIM outperforms 2hnu-FM and FM, while CFM has a better axial resolution at NAs above 0.8.},

abstract = {The noncanonical wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway [1] regulates the mediolaterally (planarly) polarized cell protrusive activity and intercalation that drives the convergent extension movements of vertebrate gastrulation [2], yet the underlying mechanism is unknown. We report that perturbing expression of Xenopus PCP genes, Strabismus (Xstbm), Frizzled (Xfz7), and Prickle (Xpk), disrupts radially polarized fibronectin fibril assembly on mesodermal tissue surfaces, mediolaterally polarized motility, and intercalation. Polarized motility is restored in Xpk-perturbed explants but not in Xstbm- or Xfz7-perturbed explants cultured on fibronectin surfaces. The PCP complex, including Xpk, first regulates polarized surface assembly of the fibronectin matrix, which is necessary for mediolaterally polarized motility, and then, without Xpk, has an additional and necessary function in polarizing motility. These results show that the PCP complex regulates several cell polarities (radial, planar) and several processes (matrix deposition, motility), by indirect and direct mechanisms, and acts in several modes, either with all or a subset of its components, during vertebrate morphogenesis.},

abstract = {Cells and the tissues they form are not passive material bodies. Cells change their behavior in response to external biochemical and biomechanical cues. Behavioral changes, such as morphological deformation, proliferation and migration, are striking in many multicellular processes such as morphogenesis, wound healing and cancer progression. Cell-based modeling of these phenomena requires algorithms that can capture active cell behavior and their emergent tissue-level phenotypes. In this paper, we report on extensions of the subcellular element model to model active biomechanical subcellular processes. These processes lead to emergent cell and tissue level phenotypes at larger scales, including (i) adaptive shape deformations in cells responding to slow stretching, (ii) viscous flow of embryonic tissues, and (iii) streaming patterns of chemotactic cells in epithelial-like sheets. In each case, we connect our simulation results to recent experiments.},

abstract = {Signalling through Frizzled (Fz)/planar cell polarity (PCP) is a conserved mechanism that polarizes cells along specific axes in a tissue. Genetic screens in Drosophila melanogaster pioneered the discovery of core PCP factors, which regulate the orientation of hairs on wings and facets in eyes. Recent genetic evidence shows that the Fz/PCP pathway is conserved in vertebrates and is crucial for disparate processes as gastrulation and sensory cell orientation. Fz/PCP signalling depends on complex interactions between core components, leading to their asymmetric distribution and ultimately polarized activity in a cell. Whereas several mechanistic aspects of PCP have been uncovered, the global coordination of this polarization remains debated.},

title = {Identification and characterization of roundabout orthologs in zebrafish},
abstract = {The Roundabout (Robo) family of receptors and their extracellular ligands, the Slit protein family, play important roles in repulsive axon guidance. First identified in Drosophila, Robo receptors form an evolutionarily conserved sub-family of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that are characterized by the presence of five Ig repeats and three fibronectin-type III repeats in the extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with several conserved motifs that play important roles in Robo-mediated signaling (Cell 92 (1998) 205; Cell 101 (2000) 703). Robo family members have now been identified in C. elegans, Xenopus, rat, mouse, and human (Cell 92 (1998) 205; Cell 92 (1998) 217; Cell 96 (1999) 807; Dev. Biol. 207 (1999) 62). Furthermore, multiple robo genes have been described in Drosophila, rat, mouse and humans, raising the possibility of potential redundancy and diversity in robo gene function. As a first step in elucidating the role of Robo receptors during vertebrate development, we identified and characterized two Robo family members from zebrafish. We named these zebrafish genes robo1 and robo3, reflecting their amino acid sequence similarity to other vertebrate robo genes. Both genes are dynamically expressed in the developing nervous system in distinct patterns. robo3 is expressed during the first day of development in the hindbrain and spinal cord and is later expressed in the tectum and retina. robo1 nervous system expression appears later in development and is more restricted. Moreover, both genes are expressed in non-neuronal tissues consistent with additional roles for these genes during development.},

title = {Cell migration during morphogenesis},
abstract = {During development, functional structures must form with the correct three-dimensional geometry composed of the correct cell types. In many cases cell types are specified at locations distant to where they will ultimately reside for normal biological function. Although cell migration is crucial for normal development and morphogenesis of animal body plans and organ systems, abnormal cell migration during adult life underlies pathological states such as invasion and metastasis of cancer. In both contexts cells migrate either individually, as loosely associated sheets or as clusters of cells. In this review, we summarize, compare and integrate knowledge gained from several in vivo model systems that have yielded insights into the regulation of morphogenic cell migration, such as the zebrafish lateral line primordium and primordial germ cells, Drosophila border cell clusters, vertebrate neural crest migration and angiogenic sprouts in the post-natal mouse retina. Because of its broad multicontextual and multiphylletic distribution, understanding cell migration in its various manifestations in vivo is likely to provide new insights into both the function and malfunction of key embryonic and postembryonic events. In this review, we will provide a succinct phenotypic description of the many model systems utilized to study cell migration in vivo. More importantly, we will highlight, compare and integrate recent advances in our understanding of how cell migration is regulated in these varied model systems with special emphasis on individual and collective cell movements.},

abstract = {Physically, the course of morphogenesis is determined by the distribution and timing of force production in the embryo and by the mechanical properties of the tissues on which these forces act. We have miniaturized a standard materials-testing procedure (the stress-relaxation test) to measure the viscoelastic properties of the dorsal involuting marginal zone, prechordal mesoderm, and vegetal endoderm of Xenopus laevis embryos during gastrulation. We focused on the involuting marginal zone, because it undergoes convergent extension (an important and wide-spread morphogenetic process) and drives involution, blastopore closure and elongation of the embryonic axis. We show that the involuting marginal zone stiffens during gastrulation, stiffening is a special property of this region rather than a general property of the whole embryo, stiffening is greater along the anteroposterior axis than the mediolateral axis and changes in the cytoskeleton or extracellular matrix are necessary for stiffening, although changes in cell-cell adhesions or cell-matrix adhesions are not ruled out. These findings provide a baseline of data on which future experiments can be designed and make specific, testable predictions about the roles of the cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix and intercellular adhesion in convergent extension, as well as predictions about the morphogenetic role of convergent extension in early development.},

The main issue looks at the development of a biological mathematical theory for multicellular systems. The first part is devoted to the derivation of mathematical structures to be properly used to model a variety of biological phenomena with special focus on immune competition. Then, some specific applications are proposed referring to the competition between neoplastic and immune cells. Finally, the last part is devoted to research perspectives towards the objective of developing a mathematical-biological theory. A critique is presented of what has already been achieved towards the above target and what is still missing with special focus on multiscale systems.},

title = {Multiscale computational analysis of Xenopus laevis morphogenesis reveals key insights of systems-level behavior},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tissue morphogenesis is a complex process whereby tissue structures self-assemble by the aggregate behaviors of independently acting cells responding to both intracellular and extracellular cues in their environment. During embryonic development, morphogenesis is particularly important for organizing cells into tissues, and although key regulatory events of this process are well studied in isolation, a number of important systems-level questions remain unanswered. This is due, in part, to a lack of integrative tools that enable the coupling of biological phenomena across spatial and temporal scales. Here, we present a new computational framework that integrates intracellular signaling information with multi-cell behaviors in the context of a spatially heterogeneous tissue environment.

RESULTS: We have developed a computational simulation of mesendoderm migration in the Xenopus laevis explant model, which is a well studied biological model of tissue morphogenesis that recapitulates many features of this process during development in humans. The simulation couples, via a JAVA interface, an ordinary differential equation-based mass action kinetics model to compute intracellular Wnt/beta-catenin signaling with an agent-based model of mesendoderm migration across a fibronectin extracellular matrix substrate. The emergent cell behaviors in the simulation suggest the following properties of the system: maintaining the integrity of cell-to-cell contact signals is necessary for preventing fractionation of cells as they move, contact with the Fn substrate and the existence of a Fn gradient provides an extracellular feedback loop that governs migration speed, the incorporation of polarity signals is required for cells to migrate in the same direction, and a delicate balance of integrin and cadherin interactions is needed to reproduce experimentally observed migratory behaviors.

CONCLUSION: Our computational framework couples two different spatial scales in biology: intracellular with multicellular. In our simulation, events at one scale have quantitative and dynamic impact on events at the other scale. This integration enables the testing and identification of key systems-level hypotheses regarding how signaling proteins affect overall tissue-level behavior during morphogenesis in an experimentally verifiable system. Applications of this approach extend to the study of tissue patterning processes that occur during adulthood and disease, such as tumorgenesis and atherogenesis.},

abstract = {Epiboly, the spreading and the thinning of the blastoderm to cover the yolk cell and close the blastopore in fish embryos, is central to the process of gastrulation. Despite its fundamental importance, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control this coordinated cell movement. By a combination of knockdown studies and rescue experiments in zebrafish (Danio rerio), we show that epiboly relies on the molecular networking of syntenin with syndecan heparan sulphate proteoglycans, which act as co-receptors for adhesion molecules and growth factors. Furthermore, we show that the interaction of syntenin with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and with the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6), which regulate the endocytic recycling of syndecan, is necessary for epiboly progression. Analysis of the earliest cellular defects suggests a role for syntenin in the autonomous vegetal expansion of the yolk syncytial layer and the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in extra-embryonic tissues, but not in embryonic cell fate determination. This study identifies the importance of the syntenin-syndecan-PIP2-Arf6 complex for the progression of fish epiboly and establishes its key role in directional cell movements during early development.},

title = {Extracellular matrix macroassembly dynamics in early vertebrate embryos},
abstract = {This chapter focuses on the in vivo macroassembly dynamics of fibronectin and fibrillin-2--two prominent extracellular matrix (ECM) components, present in vertebrate embryos at the earliest stages of development. The ECM is an inherently dynamic structure with a well-defined position fate: ECM filaments are not only anchored to and move with established tissue boundaries, but are repositioned prior to the formation of new anatomical features. We distinguish two ECM filament relocation processes-each operating on different length scales. First, ECM filaments are moved by large-scale tissue motion, which rearranges major organ primordia within the embryo. The second type of motion, on the scale of the individual ECM filaments, is driven by local motility and protrusive activity of nearby cells. The motion decomposition is made practically possible by recent advances in microscopy and high-resolution particle image velocimetry algorithms. We demonstrate that both kinds of motion contribute substantially to the establishment of normal ECM structure, and both must be taken into account when attempting to understand ECM macroassembly during embryonic morphogenesis. The tissue-scale motion changes the local amount (density) and the tissue-level structure (e.g., orientation) of ECM fibers. Local reorganization includes filament assembly and the segregation of ECM into specific patterns. Local reorganization takes place most actively at Hensen's node and around the primitive streak. These regions are also sites of active cell migration, where fibrillin-2 and fibronectin are often colocalized in ECM globules, and new fibrillin-2 foci are deposited. During filament assembly, the globular patches of ECM are joined into larger linear structures in a hierarchical process: increasingly larger structures are created by the aggregation of smaller units. A future understanding of ECM assembly thus requires the study of the complex interactions between biochemical assembly steps, local cell action, and tissue motion.},

Primordial germ cells (PGCs), precursors to sperm and eggs, have to migrate across the embryo to reach somatic gonadal precursors, where they carry out their function. Studies of model organisms have revealed that, despite important differences, several features of PGC migration are conserved. PGCs require an intrinsic motility programme and external guidance cues to survive and successfully migrate. Proper guidance involves both attractive and repulsive cues and is mediated by protein and lipid signalling.},

Using this principle, we have constructed a device, called an optical stretcher, that can be used to measure the viscoelastic properties of dielectric materials, including biologic materials such as cells, with the sensitivity necessary to distinguish even between different individual cytoskeletal phenotypes. We have successfully used the optical stretcher to deform human erythrocytes and mouse fibroblasts. In the optical stretcher, no focusing is required, thus radiation damage is minimized and the surface forces are not limited by the light power. The magnitude of the deforming forces in the optical stretcher thus bridges the gap between optical tweezers and atomic force microscopy for the study of biologic materials.},

title = {Multiscale modeling of biological pattern formation},
abstract = {In the past few decades, it has become increasingly popular and important to utilize mathematical models to understand how microscopic intercellular interactions lead to the macroscopic pattern formation ubiquitous in the biological world. Modeling methodologies come in a large variety and presently it is unclear what is their interrelationship and the assumptions implicit in their use. They can be broadly divided into three categories according to the spatial scale they purport to describe: the molecular, the cellular and the tissue scales. Most models address dynamics at the tissue-scale, few address the cellular scale and very few address the molecular scale. Of course there would be no dissent between models or at least the underlying assumptions would be known if they were all rigorously derived from a molecular level model, in which case the laws of physics and chemistry are very well known. However in practice this is not possible due to the immense complexity of the problem. A simpler approach is to derive models at a coarse scale from an intermediate scale model which has the special property of being based on biology and physics which are experimentally well studied. In this article we use such an approach to understand the assumptions inherent in the use of the most popular models, the tissue-level ones. Such models are found to invariably rely on the hidden assumption that statistical correlations between cells can be neglected. This often means that the predictions of these models are qualitatively correct but may fail in spatial regions where cell concentration is small, particularly if there are strong long-range correlations in cell movement. Such behavior can only be properly taken into account by cellular models. However such models unlike the tissue-level models are frequently not easily amenable to analysis, except when the number of interacting cells is small or when the interactions are weak, and thus are rather more suited for simulation. Hence it is our conclusion that the simultaneous theoretical and numerical analysis of models of the same biological system at different spatial scales provides a more robust method of understanding biological systems than the utilization of a single scale model. In particular this enables one to clearly separate nonphysical predictions stemming from model artifacts from those due to genuine physiological behavior.},

title = {Generation of leaf shape through early pattern of growth and tissue polarity},
abstract = {A major challenge in biology is to understand how buds comprising a few cells can give rise to complex plant and animal appendages like leaves or limbs. We address this problem through a combination of time-lapse imaging, clonal analysis, and computational modeling. We arrive at a model that shows how leaf shape can arise through feedback between early patterns of oriented growth and tissue deformation. Experimental tests through partial leaf ablation support this model and allow reevaluation of previous experimental studies. Our model allows a range of observed leaf shapes to be generated and predicts observed clone patterns in different species. Thus, our experimentally validatep model underlie the development and evolution of diverse organ shapes.},

title = {Cell adaptive response to extracellular matrix density is controlled by ICAP-1-dependent beta1-integrin affinity},
abstract = {Cell migration is an integrated process requiring the continuous coordinated assembly and disassembly of adhesion structures. How cells orchestrate adhesion turnover is only partially understood. We provide evidence for a novel mechanistic insight into focal adhesion (FA) dynamics by demonstrating that integrin cytoplasmic domain-associated protein 1 (ICAP-1) slows down FA assembly. Live cell imaging, which was performed in both Icap-1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and cells expressing active beta(1) integrin, shows that the integrin high affinity state favored by talin is antagonistically controlled by ICAP-1. This affinity switch results in modulation in the speed of FA assembly and, consequently, of cell spreading and migration. Unexpectedly, the ICAP-1-dependent decrease in integrin affinity allows cell sensing of matrix surface density, suggesting that integrin conformational changes are important in mechanotransduction. Our results clarify the function of ICAP-1 in cell adhesion and highlight the central role it plays in the cell's integrated response to the extracellular microenvironment.},

title = {Models for the generation and interpretation of gradients},
abstract = {Source regions for morphogen gradients-organizing regions-can be generated if a local self-enhancing reaction is coupled with a long-ranging reaction that acts antagonistically. Resulting gradients can be translated into patterns of stable gene activities using genes whose products have a positive feedback on the activation on themselves. If several autoregulatory genes compete with each other for activity, cells make an unequivocal choice. Although the signal consists of a smoothly graded distribution, the all-or-nothing response of the cells leads to regions of differently determined cells that are delimited by sharp borders. In some systems, it is not the absolute but the relative level of a gradient that matters. The sequence of head, tentacles, and foot formation in hydra is controlled by a head activation gradient and is an example of this widely used but conceptually rather neglected mode. For subpatterns such as legs and wings, different "compartments" cooperate to produce new signaling substances. Here, morphogen production is restricted to the common borders or where they intersect. The model accounts for the formation of substructures in pairs at the correct positions within the embryo and for the correct orientation and handedness with respect to the main body axes.},

abstract = {Rapid and sequential cell shape changes take place during the formation of the ventral furrow (VF) at the beginning of Drosophila gastrulation. At the cellular level, this morphogenetic event demands close coordination of the proteins involved in actin cytoskeletal reorganization. In order to construct a regulatory network that describes these cell shape changes, we have used published genetic and molecular data for 18 genes encoding transcriptional regulators and signaling pathway components. Based on the dynamic behavior of this network we explored the hypothesis that the combination of three recognizable phenotypes describing wild type or mutant cell types, during VF invagination, correspond to different activation states of a specific set of these gene products, which are point attractors of the regulatory network. From our results, we recognize missing components in the regulatory network and suggest alternative pathways in the regulation of cell shape changes during VF formation.},

title = {Fly fishing for collective cell migration},
abstract = {The collective migration of cells is essential for organogenesis. It requires the establishment of spatial information within the cellular group and a mechanism that controls the onset of cell movement and migratory arrest. In this review I will use two examples of collective cell migration, from Drosophila and the zebrafish, to discuss how genetic analyses have helped to unravel some basic aspects of collective cell migration. Following, I will suggest some general experimental approaches to further advance our understanding of the mechanisms that control the migration of cellular collectives.},

title = {no tail integrates two modes of mesoderm induction},
abstract = {During early zebrafish development the nodal signalling pathway patterns the embryo into three germ layers, in part by inducing the expression of no tail (ntl), which is essential for correct mesoderm formation. When nodal signalling is inhibited ntl fails to be expressed in the dorsal margin, but ventral ntl expression is unaffected. These observations indicate that ntl transcription is under both nodal-dependent and nodal-independent regulation. Consistent with these observations and with a role for ntl in mesoderm formation, some somites form within the tail region of embryos lacking nodal signalling. In an effort to understand how ntl is regulated and thus how mesoderm forms, we have mapped the elements responsible for nodal-dependent and nodal-independent expression of ntl in the margin of the embryo. Our work demonstrates that expression of ntl in the margin is the consequence of two separate enhancers, which act to mediate different mechanisms of mesoderm formation. One of these enhancers responds to nodal signalling, and the other to Wnt and BMP signalling. We demonstrate that the nodal-independent regulation of ntl is essential for tail formation. Misexpression of Wnt and BMP ligands can induce the formation of an ectopic tail, which contains somites, in embryos devoid of nodal signalling, and this tail formation is dependent on ntl function. Similarly, nodal-independent tail somite formation requires ntl. At later stages in development ntl is required for notochord formation, and our analysis has also led to the identification of the enhancer required for ntl expression in the developing notochord.},
