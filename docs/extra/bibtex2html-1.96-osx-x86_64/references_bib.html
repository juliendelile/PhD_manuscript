  abstract = {The tissue polarity genes control the polarity of hairs, bristles
  and ommatidia in the adult epidermis of Drosophila. We report here the
  identification of a new tissue polarity gene named starry night (stan).
  Mutations in this essential gene alter the polarity of cuticular structures
  in all regions of the adult body. The detailed polarity phenotype of stan on
  the wing suggested that it is most likely a component of the frizzled (fz)
  pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, stan appears to be downstream of
  and required for fz function. We molecularly cloned stan and found that it
  encodes a huge protocadherin containing nine cadherin motifs, four EGF-like
  motifs, two laminin G motifs, and seven transmembrane domains. This suggests
  that Stan functions in signal reception, perhaps together with Fz.},
